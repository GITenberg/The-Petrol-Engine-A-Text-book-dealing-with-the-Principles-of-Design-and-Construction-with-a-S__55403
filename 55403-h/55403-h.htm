<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>


<p>This book deals with <i>principles</i>. There are many books
which give a descriptive account of existing types of engines,
but my object in writing this volume has been to assist the
reader to obtain thoroughly sound notions of the <i>principles</i>
of design and construction which underlie all current practice.
If a man understands, for example, the construction of
the <i>elements</i> of a carburettor and how they ought to perform
their several functions, he should have no difficulty in
understanding any special type of carburettor placed upon
the market. In dealing with the subject of ignition I have
purposely avoided any detailed explanation of the manner
in which the spark discharge is produced, because I felt
that it introduces new ideas and probably causes the reader
to lose sight of the fact that the magneto is only, after all,
an <i>accessory</i>, although of course a most important one. I
hope that the accounts of my experiments with the <i>two-stroke</i>
will be of some service to inventors and others; the
many extraordinary breakdowns, defects and adventures
encountered during this period of my career have not been
inserted because they would undoubtedly cause the reader
to forget, for the time being, his fundamental <i>principles</i>.</p>

<p>My colleague, Mr. Oliver Mitchell, who lectures at the
Polytechnic on “Motor Car Management and Inspection,”
has read through the proofs for me and very kindly sug<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">xiv</span>gested
several small additions to the text, which I have
incorporated; he also suggested the insertion of the valve-setting
diagram in the Appendix. My thanks are due
to Mr. Mitchell for his services and also to my wife for her
assistance in the preparation of the Index.</p>

<p><b>Explosive Mixtures.</b>—If a small quantity of liquid
petrol or benzol be placed in an open vessel and exposed
to a current of air it will quickly disappear or <i>evaporate</i>.
We say that the liquid petrol has been vaporized or turned
into <i>petrol vapour</i>.
A mixture of air and
petrol vapour can be
ignited and burnt,
the rate of burning
being affected by the
<i>strength</i> of the mixture.
The strength
of the mixture is
determined by measuring
the respective
volumes of air and
petrol vapour present
in a known volume
of the mixture. It is
possible to form a
mixture of air and
petrol vapour in such
proportions that
when ignited by an
electric spark it will
be completely burnt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
at such a rate that the combustion is almost instantaneous,
i.e., it will <i>explode</i>. This mixture of air and petrol vapour
would then be referred to as an <i>explosive mixture</i> and would
be suitable for supplying to the cylinder of a petrol engine.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="pcap">Fig. 2.—Diagram to Explain the<br />Meaning
 of “Compression.”</p></div>
</div>

<p><b>The Meaning
of Suction.</b>—Imagine
an iron cylinder
A (Fig. <a href="#fig_1">1</a>) held
down on a
rigid base C
and fitted with
a gas-tight
piston B. If
we pull the
piston down
sharply to the
position shown
in Fig. <a href="#fig_2">2</a> we
will realize that
there is apparently
some
force inside the
cylinder which
is trying to
<i>suck</i> the piston
up again. The
fact that the
piston is being
withdrawn and
no more air or
gas admitted above it to fill up the volume it has displaced
on its descent causes a partial vacuum in the cylinder. Now
if by means of a tap or valve of some kind we could put the
cylinder in communication with the atmosphere, air would
rush in and fill up the cylinder until the pressure of the gases<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
in it became equal to atmospheric pressure, when no more
air could enter, because there would be no <i>excess of pressure</i>
to force it in. In technical language we would say, “the
piston has <b>sucked in a charge</b> of air” through the tap
or valve.</p>

<a id="fig_3"></a>
<img src="images/i_003.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="pcap">Fig. 3.—Otto Cycle.<br />The Suction Stroke.</p></div>
</div>
<p><b>The Meaning of Compression.</b>—Close
the tap or
valve and push
the piston up
again sharply to
its original position
of Fig. <a href="#fig_1">1</a>.
You will now encounter
considerable
resistance and
experience a force
pushing down
against you because
you are
reducing the volume
of the gas
and thereby
increasing its
pressure; that is
to say, you are
<i>compressing</i> the
gas, because you
are now making
an amount of gas
that recently occupied the whole cylinder fit itself into
the small space between the top of the cylinder and the
crown of the piston. In technical language you would say,
“the piston has now <b>compressed the charge</b>” of gas
within the cylinder.</p>

<a id="fig_4"></a>
<img src="images/i_004.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="pcap">Fig. 4.—Otto Cycle.<br />The Compression
Stroke.</p></div>
</div>

<p><b>The Meaning, of a Stroke.</b>—In an engine such as is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
shown diagrammatically in Figs. <a href="#fig_3">3</a> and <a href="#fig_4">4</a>, when the piston
P moves from its topmost position in the cylinder down
to its very lowest position we say it has completed a <i>downstroke</i>,
and when it moves upwards from its lowest to its
highest position we say the piston has completed an
<i>upstroke</i>. The
length of the piston’s
stroke is
equal to twice the
length of the crank
radius R, and is
measured by observing
the distance
moved by
the piston in
travelling from its
highest position in
the cylinder to its
lowest or vice
versa. The space
existing above the
piston between it
and the cylinder
head when the
piston has reached
its highest position
in the cylinder is
called the <i>clearance
space</i>. It is also
referred to as the
<i>combustion chamber</i>,
or chamber in which the petrol gas is exploded. When
the piston is either at the top or bottom of its stroke the
crank radius R and connecting rod T are in one and the
same straight line; under these conditions we say the
crank is on its inner or outer <i>dead-centre</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span></p>

<p><b>The Otto Cycle.</b>—Most petrol engines operate on what
is known as the “Otto” cycle, in which the cycle of events
is completed once in every four strokes (or <i>two</i> revolutions)
made by the engine. The “Otto” cycle is therefore
usually referred to as the <i>four-stroke</i> cycle. In the accompanying
diagrams
(Figs. <a href="#fig_3">3</a>,
<a href="#fig_4">4</a>, <a href="#fig_5">5</a>, and <a href="#fig_6">6</a>) we
show in diagrammatic
form
the interior of a
petrol engine
cylinder fitted
with mushroom
type valves.</p>

<div class="figright">
<a id="fig_5"></a>
<img src="images/i_005.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="pcap">Fig. 5.—Otto Cycle.<br />The Power Stroke.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In studying
the figures we
assume the
engine is being
cranked round
by hand in the
direction of the
arrow while we
view it from the
“flywheel” end
(i.e. the end
adjacent to the
driver’s seat),
then A is the
pipe which leads
the mixture of
air and petrol vapour from the <i>carburettor</i> to the cylinder
and is called the <i>induction pipe</i>. C is the cylinder,
P the piston, I the inlet valve, E the exhaust valve, T
the connecting rod, R the crank, and S the sparking
plug. The pipe B which leads the burnt gases from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
exhaust valve to the <i>silencer</i> is called the <i>exhaust pipe</i>.
The cycle of operations is as follows:—</p>

<div class="figright">
<a id="fig_6"></a>
<img src="images/i_006.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="pcap">Fig. 6.—Otto Cycle.<br />The Exhaust Stroke.</p></div>
</div>

<p>(1) <b>On the first downstroke</b> made by the piston a
suction effect or partial vacuum is produced in the cylinder;
the air and petrol vapour in the induction pipe being at
atmospheric
pressure, which
is in excess of
that now existing
in the cylinder,
flow into
the cylinder as
soon as the
inlet valve I is
opened by the
engine mechanism.
At the
end of this, <i>the
suction stroke</i>,
the inlet valve
closes and traps
the charge of
explosive mixture
in the
engine cylinder.
This is shown
in Fig. <a href="#fig_3">3</a>.</p>

<p>(2) <b>On the
first upstroke</b>
made
by the piston
the charge of explosive mixture is compressed ready for
firing. Both valves are shut. This is shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_4">4</a>.</p>

<p>(3) <b>On the second downstroke</b> made by the piston
the sparking plug S passes a spark which explodes the
charge at the very commencement of the downward move<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>ment
of the piston. The force of the explosion drives the
piston downwards, doing useful work. Both valves are
shut. This is the <i>power stroke</i>, and sufficient power must be
developed on this stroke not only to do the work required
from the engine but also to tide it over the other three
<i>idle</i> strokes. On this stroke the piston drives the crank
by means of the connecting rod, but on the other three
strokes of the cycle the crank has to drive the piston by
means of the power or energy stored in the engine flywheel
on the power stroke. Towards the end of the power stroke
(or explosion stroke) the engine mechanism opens the
exhaust valve E and allows part of the burnt gases to
escape to the silencer along the exhaust pipe. This is
shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_5">5</a>.</p>

<p>(4) <b>On the second upstroke</b> of the cycle the piston
pushes the remaining burnt gases out of the cylinder through
the exhaust valve. When the piston reaches the top of
its stroke the exhaust valve closes. This is shown in Fig.
6. The cycle of operations then begins again, giving one
power stroke and three idle strokes each time as already
described.</p>

<b>DESCRIPTION OF A TYPICAL PETROL ENGINE</b></h2>


<p>For the purpose of explaining the cycle of operations we
have considered only a diagrammatic sketch of an imaginary
motor-car engine, but in Fig. <a href="#fig_7">7</a> we illustrate an up-to-date
motor-car engine. In the first place we note the position
and arrangement of the four water-cooled cylinders, A<sub>1</sub>,
A<sub>2</sub>, A<sub>3</sub>, A<sub>4</sub>, containing their pistons and mushroom type
valves. These are conveniently placed in a vertical position
and mounted on top of the crankchamber C, to the bottom
of which is attached the oil-base B. At the front of the
engine are shown the timing wheels in their casing E, and
at the rear end the flywheel F. The starting-handle connexion
is at S, the fan pulley being shown at M. The
high tension magneto which supplies the current to the
sparking plugs is shown at H, and I is the induction pipe
connected to the carburettor K. The water circulating
pump is on the off side of the engine and does not appear
in the illustration, but L<sub>1</sub> is the inlet water pipe leading
from the radiator (not shown) to the water pump, and L<sub>2</sub> is
the delivery pipe from the pump to the respective cylinder
jackets, L<sub>3</sub> being the outlet water pipe. The exhaust pipe
is shown at D, and the oil pump at P. The valve springs,
valve tappets and guides can also be clearly seen. In

<div class="caption"><p class="pcap">Fig. 7.—General Arrangement of a Modern Petrol Engine.</p></div>
</div>

<p><b>The Cylinder.</b>—Probably one of the most important
parts of an engine is the cylinder. As we have already
seen, it is inside the cylinder that the charge of petrol<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
vapour and air is exploded and completely burnt. The heat
energy of the petrol mixture which is liberated by the
explosion is immediately transformed into mechanical
work and propels the piston forward like a projectile from
a gun. But we must also notice that our present-day
arrangements (clever as they are) are by no means perfect,
and we cannot, even under the most favourable circumstances,
convert more than about <i>one-third</i> of the heat
energy of the petrol mixture into the mechanical energy
of the moving piston. Of the remaining two-thirds of the
heat, part is used up in heating the cylinder walls, the
piston and the valves, and the remainder goes out with the
exhaust gases to the silencer, finally escaping to the outside
air. Thus two important facts are brought to our notice:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span></p>

<p>(1) The reason why we use petrol to drive our motor-cars
is because petrol (and certain other liquid fuels such
as benzol, etc.) contains within itself a store of energy
which can be liberated as heat when the fuel is burnt or
exploded in the presence of air in the engine cylinder.</p>

<p>(2) At the present day, even with our most up-to-date
contrivances, we cannot make use of two-thirds of the available
heat in our petrol. Instead of being able to turn this
heat into useful mechanical work, we are compelled to
throw it away—to waste it. Further than that, we have
to make special provision to ensure that it shall be wasted
as quickly as possible and as easily as possible. We take
out the greatest amount that we can possibly turn into
work and then hasten to dissipate the remaining two-thirds.
We cast hollow chambers on the outside of our cylinders
through which we circulate cold water to keep down the
heat in the cylinder walls; if our cylinder walls and piston
get too hot our engine may seize up, therefore we must
cool them to ensure satisfactory running. Again we make
large exhaust valves and provide a free escape through the
silencer for the exhaust gases, so that when we have snatched
our useful one-third of the heat supply we may throw the
remainder away into the atmosphere as rapidly as possible.—this
part is of no use to us, we cannot turn it into work,
then why let it stay here and heat our cylinder walls and
piston still further?</p>

<p>It is a good plan to extend this hollow chamber, containing
the water in circulation, at least round the whole of the
combustion chamber and all round the inlet and exhaust
valve passages and down the barrel of the cylinder as far
as the walls are likely to come into contact with the hot
gases from the explosions. We refer to this hollow chamber,
with its circulating water, as the <i>water-jacket</i> of the cylinder.
It is not absolutely <i>essential</i> to have our cylinder water-jacketed,
especially with small engines for motor-cycles
and engines for aeroplanes which have revolving cylinders,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
but it is practically essential in nearly all other cases.
Even in the special cases mentioned it is found necessary
to form special heat radiating fins on the outside of the
heated walls to assist in dissipating or getting rid of the
surplus heat and preventing seizure of the piston within
the cylinder. These fins are clearly seen on the cylinder
of the motor-cycle engine shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_13">13</a>.</p>

<p>Thus we may say that motor-car engine cylinders are
bound to be water-jacketed, i.e., to have a hollow space
round them containing water in circulation. The cylinders
themselves are nearly always made in the form of iron
castings and the jacket spaces form part of the <i>cylinder
casting</i> as a general rule, but occasionally the water-jacket
space is formed by attaching plates or tubes to the cylinder
casting by means of bolts or screws—not an easy thing
to arrange successfully, as it requires water-tight joints.</p>

<p>The procedure for manufacturing a motor-car cylinder
is first of all to design and calculate the proportions of the
various parts and get out a set of working drawings. From
these drawings we get <i>patterns</i> and <i>core-boxes</i> made in wood.
The patterns are the exact shape of the finished cylinder
on the <i>outside</i>, and the core-boxes are the exact shape of the
<i>inside</i> of the finished cylinder (except in so far as allowance
has to be made for parts which must afterwards be machined).</p>

<p>The patterns are pushed down into the moulding sand
in the foundry, and when withdrawn leave their impression,
thus forming <i>moulds</i>. The core-boxes are filled with sand,
which when withdrawn furnishes us with masses of sand that
are the counterpart of the interior of the cylinder in shape.
These <i>cores</i> are supported centrally in the mould (which
is usually in halves, or <i>more</i> than two parts), while the molten
iron is poured into the intervening space to form the iron
<i>casting</i>. When the casting has cooled down the sand can be
cleaned off quite easily. One set of patterns and core-boxes
will thus produce quite a number of cylinder castings,
each being similar in every respect to the other, the process<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
being a quick and fairly cheap method of reproduction.
Later on the cylinder barrel has to be machined and bored
out true to very fine limits by the use of boring tools and
some kind of boring machine or lathe. The flanges or flat
faces have to be planed true in a planing machine and the
valve stem guides and valve seatings must be carefully
and truly machined to correct size and shape.</p>

flanges. The flange f<sub>1</sub> is used for attaching the cylinder
to the crankchamber; while it is quite true that the
force of the explosion within the cylinder drives the
piston downwards, it is equally true that it also tends
to force the cylinder head off or to blow the cylinder
casting upwards off the crankchamber, unless it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
securely fastened to it by means of screws or bolts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>

for the inlet and outlet water pipe attachments, and
f<sub>4</sub>, f<sub>5</sub> are for the induction pipe and exhaust pipe
connexions. Generally the pipes will have flanges and
be held tight against the flanges on the cylinder casting
by means of screws or studs. Figs. <a href="#fig_10">10</a>,
<a href="#fig_11">11</a>, and <a href="#fig_12">12</a> show
how two metal flanges are held in contact by means of

<p>In Figs. <a href="#fig_8">8</a> and <a href="#fig_9">9</a> the valves are placed one on each
side of the cylinder, this form of cylinder being known as a
<b>T</b>-headed cylinder, but it is rather more usual here in
England to place both valves on the same side of the cylinder
and next to each other as indicated in Fig. <a href="#fig_13">13</a>, this form<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
of cylinder being known as an <b>L</b>-headed cylinder. The chief
object is of course to avoid the use of two valve shafts
and also to produce a neater looking engine, but the <i>T</i>-headed
design is better cleaned or scavenged by the passage
of the inlet and exhaust gases. When a motor-car engine
has two cylinders we frequently find them both in a single
casting, having a common water-jacket, and then we say
they are <i>cast in pairs</i>. A four-cylinder engine may thus
have: (1) Cylinders <i>cast separately</i>; (2) Cylinders <i>cast in
pairs</i>; (3) Cylinders <i>cast en bloc</i>; or all four in a single large
casting. The third method is cheapest in first cost, but
in the event of breakage will become the most expensive.
The second method is a sound compromise.</p>

<p>An example of a <i>built-up</i> cylinder and water-jacket is
shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_14">14</a>, the cylinder barrel being of steel tube with
steel flanges, and the water-jacket being formed by copper
tube slipped over the outside of the steel cylinder. Its
great advantage lies in the reduction of weight, and it is
thus largely used for aeroplane work. The valves would
then be fitted in the top cover of the cylinder and driven
by overhead gearing.</p>

<b>ENGINE DETAILS</b></h2>


<p><b>The Piston</b> is perhaps the most important detail to
consider, for it is on the piston that the force of the explosion
acts when the heat energy is converted into mechanical
energy. It must be made sufficiently strong to withstand
the bursting effect of successive explosions, and yet if we
make the metal too thick it will retain too much of the
<i>waste heat</i> and the piston may <i>seize</i> in the cylinder due to
expansion. To understand why the piston is likely to
seize in the cylinder we have only to remember that when a
metal body is heated it gets larger in every direction, but
if cooled it returns to its original size. Now if we make the
metal of the piston too thick so that the waste heat cannot
pass <i>quickly</i> through it and dissipate itself at cooler parts
of the engine, then the bulk of this heat will be concentrated
in the piston head, causing it to expand and become a
tight fit in the cylinder, as the cylinder walls are fairly
thin and in contact with the jacket water which keeps
them fairly cool and prevents them expanding much
above their normal size. The actual amount of expansion
is very small of course, but there is very little <i>clearance</i>
between the piston and the cylinder walls, even when the
engine is all cold—perhaps five-thousandths of an inch.
The piston therefore must be strong, yet as light as we can
make it, having regard to the necessity for its being amply
stiff and rigid and able to <i>stand up to</i> its work.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="pcap">Fig. 15.—Two views of a Cast Iron Piston with Gudgeon Pin and
 Packing Rings.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Generally it will be an iron casting in the form of a small
cylinder (see Fig. <a href="#fig_15">15</a>), having provision in it for the packing
rings P, and the gudgeon pin G, with its fastening screws<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>. The piston itself, as we have observed, must be a
nice sliding fit in the bore of the cylinder without any shake
or side play when there are no packing rings in the grooves.
The packing rings are turned to size so as to fit the cylinder
exactly and prevent any gas leaking past the piston into the
crankchamber. These rings are very light, are made from
cast iron, and arranged to break joint, as indicated, by cutting
the middle ring in the opposite direction to the two outer
ones. Bosses are cast on the inside of the piston and afterwards
bored out to receive the steel <i>gudgeon pin</i> or wrist
pin G. This pin is best made of plain parallel cylindrical
form <i>ground</i> true, and the bosses in the piston should be
reamered out to the exact size of the pin. When the pin
has been inserted the tapered screws are screwed hard up
by means of a special spanner and bear against the pin,
preventing it from coming loose or from shaking or knocking.
There are many other methods of fixing the gudgeon pin
which are not shown here; each has some special point in
its favour, but the one illustrated is undoubtedly the best
and affords a positive adjustment for wear.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 16.—Method of fixing the
Gudgeon<br /> Pin which allows for Adjustment<br /> after Wear.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>An enlarged view of one of the bosses, showing the taper
pin in detail and how the split pin Q prevents it from slacking
back by contact with the wall of the piston, is shown in
Fig. <a href="#fig_16">16</a>. Sometimes the lower part of the piston is made
lighter by drilling holes through the walls. It is very
important to reduce the weight of the piston as much as
possible, otherwise the
engine cannot attain a
high speed, so that it becomes
essential to bear
this in mind when constructing
engines for
racing purposes. Frequently
we find <i>steel</i>
pistons used, as they may
be made lighter for the
same strength, and then
steel piston rings may be
used; they are not much
in favour for ordinary
motor-car engines because
the steel pistons expand
at a greater rate than the
cast iron of the cylinder, so that there is more liability to
seizure. The crown of the piston is sometimes curved
upwards and at other times curved downwards, but more
often it is flat as shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_17">17</a>. The gudgeon pin is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
sometimes made of mild steel, and the surface is then case-hardened
in the centre where the connecting rod end bears.
At the present time it is quite as common to find gudgeon
pins made of special nickel steel or other steel alloys that
do not require case-hardening. On the whole these special<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
steels make the best gudgeon pins and stand the hardest
wear.</p>

Stamping.</p></div>
</div>

<p><b>The Connecting Rod</b> is another very important detail
of the engine mechanism, its function being to transmit the
force of the explosion from the piston to the crankshaft.</p>

<div class="figright">
<a id="fig_19"></a>
<img src="images/i_021.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="pcap">Fig. 19.—Steel Connecting<br />Rod turned
out of the Solid Bar.</p></div>
</div>

<p>One end of the connecting rod moves up and down with
the piston and oscillates (or swings to and fro) on the
gudgeon pin,
while the other
end of the connecting
rod
travels in a
circle, being
pivoted at the
crankpin and
rotating in a
circle which has
for its centre
the centre line
of the engine
crankshaft.
This is clearly
indicated in
Fig. <a href="#fig_18">18</a>. On
the <i>suction
stroke</i> of the
engine the piston
has to be <i>pulled</i> down, as we have already seen; on the
<i>explosion stroke</i> the greatest pressure acts on the piston and
<i>pushes</i> the connecting rod down. Thus sometimes the connecting
rod is being pulled and at other times it is being
pushed; in each case it has to overcome the resistance of the
engine and drive the car. It is evident, therefore, that the
character of the load carried by a connecting rod is just
about as complex and dangerous as it is possible for a system
of loading to be, and great care has to be taken in the design<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
of such rods to ensure adequate strength without undue
weight, as this would tend to keep down the maximum
speed of the engine. Another important consideration is
the <i>cost of production</i>, and for this reason one often finds it
in the form of a phosphor bronze <i>stamping</i> of I section,
although the ideal form is a round section of steel with a
straight taper from gudgeon pin to crankpin end, and having
a hole bored right up the centre to reduce the weight without
sacrificing much strength. When the rod is made in the
form of a stamping between <i>dies</i> it is possible to turn out
great quantities at very low cost and at a very rapid rate,
whereas the round steel rods would require to be machined
from the solid bar to compete in price with the others.
When phosphor bronze is used it is only necessary to bore
out carefully and face the bearings at the two ends for the
gudgeon pin and crankpin; the bearing at the crankpin
end is always formed with a removable cap to facilitate
fitting it nicely to the crankpin, journal and also to allow
for adjustment as the bearing wears. With steel rods it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
necessary to cast a white-metal lining in the crankpin
end and then bore it out to
form the bearing, but the
crosshead bearing is usually
formed by a phosphor
bronze bush. It is evident,
therefore, that the steel rods
are more expensive, but they
make a splendid mechanical
job. A steel connecting rod
is shown complete in Fig. <a href="#fig_19">19</a>.
Stamped steel rods of I section
are also commonly used
and are much better and
stronger than those made
entirely of phosphor bronze.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="pcap">Fig. 21.—Four-throw<br />Crankshaft</p></div>
</div>

<p><b>The Crankshaft</b>, as its
name implies, is a shaft with
one or more <i>cranks</i> or right-angled
bends in it. Its
function is to convert the
sliding motion of the piston
into the rotary motion of the
flywheel and revolving shaft.
A crankshaft with a single
throw (or single crank) is
shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_20">20</a>; a four-throw
crankshaft is shown
in Fig. <a href="#fig_21">21</a>; and Fig. <a href="#fig_22">22</a>
shows how an equivalent
motion can be obtained by
a single pin fixed into the
face of a flywheel. This
device (Fig. <a href="#fig_22">22</a>) is frequently
used for motor-cycle engines. Crankshafts are always made
of steel; sometimes <i>mild</i> steel is used, but more usually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
special alloys of steel containing
chrome, nickel,
vanadium, etc., are used.
The general practice at the
present time is to machine
the crankshaft direct out
of a solid bar of steel;
this requires special <i>jigs</i> for
holding the work and special
tools for cutting the metal,
but is the quickest, cheapest,
and most satisfactory
method to adopt. A few
firms specialize in this class
of work with high-grade
steel and can supply crankshafts
from stock.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="pcap">Fig. 22.—Motor-Cycle Crankpin<br />

</div>

<p>It is easily seen by examining
Fig. <a href="#fig_18">18</a> that the crankshaft
is being twisted in
overcoming the engine resistance,
while Fig. <a href="#fig_20">20</a> shows that the crankshaft is being <i>bent</i>
under the push from the connecting rod, so that we say the
material of a crankshaft is subjected to <i>combined bending and
twisting</i>, and as such a combination is not easy to resist we see
now why special steel alloys are required for safety, combined
with economy in material and reduction of weight. In Fig.
20 the <i>crankpin</i> is shown at A, the crank cheeks or <i>webs</i>
at B<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub> and the crankshaft proper at C. The portions of
the crankshaft C which work in the bearings D<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>2</sub> are
termed <i>journals</i>. A crankshaft must be very stiff and not
bend or twist sensibly, otherwise the shaft will vibrate
when the engine runs up to speed—which would be very
undesirable. It must be perfectly true with all the bearings
absolutely in line and the journals well bedded down in
their respective brasses (or bearings), otherwise mechanical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
troubles will arise.
Each crank with
its crankpin and
webs forms a lop-sided
or unbalanced
mass,
so that either (1)
each crank must
have its own
<i>balance weight</i> as
in Fig. <a href="#fig_23">23</a>, or (2)
special balancing
masses must be fitted at each end of the crankshaft. A
convenient method of balancing the crankshaft is to have
a fan pulley at one end and the flywheel at the opposite
end, so that by drilling holes in the faces of these discs
an amount of metal may be removed from them sufficient
to balance the excess weight of the respective crankpins
and webs. In Fig. <a href="#fig_24">24</a> the shaded area indicates that portion
of the crank which constitutes an
unbalanced mass. Crankshafts for high-speed
engines have always to be very
carefully balanced, otherwise the engines
will never run satisfactorily, the want of
balance being greatly aggravated as the
speed of rotation increases. Fig. <a href="#fig_25">25</a> shows
how the crankshaft of a two-cylinder engine
may be balanced by drilling holes in the
flywheel and fan pulley respectively, but the
same effect may be produced by attaching
balancing masses—this latter method would,
however, be more inconvenient and expensive.
The crankpins and journals are
<i>ground</i> truly circular after being turned in
the lathe as true as possible.</p>

<p><b>The Flywheel.</b>—We have already de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>scribed
how
the force
driving the
piston of a
motor-car
engine varies
during the
four strokes
of the cycle,
but we must note that it also varies considerably during
each individual stroke. Thus, on what is known as the
<i>explosion stroke</i> (or power stroke) of the cycle, the
pressure at the commencement of this stroke may be
exceedingly great and yet towards the end of the stroke
the gases have expanded and the exhaust valve has
been opened, so that the pressure acting on the piston
is then very small. Again, on the compression, suction,
and exhaust strokes, the piston has to be pushed or
pulled by some means, as <i>no power is being generated</i>.
Therefore, if the engine is to be self-acting and run continuously,
some means must be provided for storing up the
great force of the explosions and giving it out again on
the idle strokes. The function of the flywheel is to <i>store</i>
any energy given to it over
and above that required to
drive the car and to give it
out again when required for
performing the functions of
compressing, exhausting,
and sucking in gas, as well
as to keep the car running
steadily. It is simply a
heavy wheel mounted on
the end of the crankshaft
which, when once started revolving
at a high speed, is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
easily stopped, and which will give up part of its energy each
time its speed is reduced owing to the demands of the engine;
but when the engine is generating power the wheel will
speed up and store the excess—the mere fact that the wheel
is heavy causes these changes in speed to occur slowly,
and therefore on the whole the <i>fluctuation</i> of speed is not
great when a suitable flywheel is fitted. The flywheel does
<i>not</i> limit the <i>maximum</i> speed of the engine, as it could go on
slowly increasing in speed if no resistance was encountered
until the wheel finally <i>burst</i> or flew to pieces. Thus the
flywheel does not regulate the <i>speed</i> of the engine; it merely
smooths out the inequalities in the several <i>strokes</i> of the
“cycle.” Flywheels of motor-car engines are now always
made of steel, so that they can be safely run at speeds up
to 3,000 revolutions per minute without fear of the rim
bursting. All parts of the rim tend to fly off radially
in the direction of the arrows as shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_26">26</a> under the
action of <i>centrifugal force</i>. A built-up flywheel is shown in
Fig. <a href="#fig_27">27</a>, and one made from a single stamping of steel is
shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_28">28</a>. Generally speaking, when a coned clutch
is fitted one portion of it is formed on the inside of the
flywheel rim as indicated in these two figures. When the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
construction shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_28">28</a> is adopted the lining would
be inserted <i>after</i> the clutch cone had been put into place;
very often the lining is made up of sections which can be
readily inserted or withdrawn after the cone is in position.</p>

<b>THE VALVES</b></h2>


<p><b>Poppet Valves.</b>—Valves are provided for the purpose
of controlling the admission of the mixture to the cylinder
and also for controlling the exhaust or ejection of the burnt
gases at the end of the firing stroke. The most common
form of valve is the mushroom or <i>poppet</i> type of valve
shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_29">29</a>, in which A is the valve head, B is the
valve stem, C is the valve seating, and D is the cotter hole
for the cotter E. It will be seen that the general appearance
of the valve is a disc of steel with a fine stem to it
similar to a mushroom in general outline—hence its name.
The valve has a coned face which is kept pressed down
on a coned seating by means of the pressure of a powerful
spring F acting on the washer G, which bears against the
cotter E and thus presses down the valve stem. To ensure
that the valve shall always come down correctly on its
seating and make a gas-tight joint, the valve stem guide M
is provided.</p>

<div class="figleft">

<div class="caption"><p class="pcap">Fig. 29.—General Arrangement of a
Poppet Valve (A) with Tappet (K) and Cam (H).</p></div>
</div>

<p>The cam H raises the valve off its seat at the required
instant when the motion of the camshaft brings the cam
under the roller R. The cam lifts the roller vertically
and with it the tappet or push rod K, which slides vertically
upwards in the guide P and lifts the valve. The tappet is
provided with an adjustable head S kept in position by
the locknut T. To adjust the <i>clearance</i> between the head
of the tappet and the underside of the valve stem the locknut
T must first be slackened back and then the head S
can be screwed up or down as desired, the best clearance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
being about 1/64 of an
inch; the locknut is
then tightened down
again. During this
operation the valve
must be down on its
seat. Sometimes to
reduce the noise
arising from the
tappet striking the
valve stem, the head
of the tappet is
padded with some
material such as
hard vulcanite fibre,
but this wears down
more quickly than
steel and requires
frequent adjustment.
The latest device for
reducing the noise
arising from the
valve mechanism
consists in totally
enclosing the valve
gear and springs
either by metal
plates bolted to the
cylinder casting or
by extending the
crankchamber to
cover it all in, and then it is certain to be well lubricated.
The exhaust valve is always liable to give trouble
either from leakage or seizure or other causes due to
the great heat of the exhaust gases, so that the valves are
often made now of tungsten steel alloy which is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
much affected by heat. If a mushroom type valve
leaks it can be <i>ground in</i> and made a tight fit on its
seating, provision usually being made for this in the form
of a slot cut in the valve head, as shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_32">32</a>, for
the insertion of a screwdriver or special tool. To grind
in a valve, remove
the cap
Q by unscrewing
it, raise the
spring F by
pushing up the
washer G and
then withdraw
the cotter E.
Lift out the
valve and
smear the
coned face with
fine emery
powder and oil
(or water).
Put the valve
back and turn
it to and fro
on its seating
by means of the
screwdriver,
keeping a firm
pressure down
on it; continue the operation until by examining the valve
you ascertain that it touches on the seating all the way
round, then couple up the spring again, after carefully
removing all traces of the emery powder.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Sleeve Valves.</b>—Another form of valve which has
come very much into favour is the sleeve valve, two views
of which are shown in Figs. <a href="#fig_30">30</a> and <a href="#fig_31">31</a>. In this case the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
gases enter the cylinder through ports or slots P cut in the
cylindrical cast iron sleeves S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>, which are placed between
the piston K and the walls of the water-jacketed cylinder
C. These sleeves are moved up and down inside the
cylinder, while the piston travels up and down inside the
inner sleeve S<sub>2</sub>
just as though it
constituted the
cylinder C. Some
engines have two
sleeves, as shown
in the figure, but
others have only
one sleeve, and
there is very little
to choose between
the two types on
the score of efficiency.
The great
claim made for the
sleeve valve is
that it is almost
noiseless in action
and gives very
much fuller openings
for inlet and
outlet of the gases.
The piston has the
usual number of
packing rings to
keep it gas-tight, and there is also a deep packing ring
provided in the head of the cylinder H to keep the sleeve
S<sub>2</sub> gas-tight and prevent loss of compression pressure.
The head of the cylinder is usually detachable, and
has often separate water connexions in the form of
pipes leading from the cylinder jackets. The sleeves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
receive their reciprocating motion from eccentrics and
rods attached to pins shown at the bottom right-hand
corner of each sleeve. It might be expected that the
sleeves would get very hot or very dry and seize up, or
the piston might seize, but in actual practice this has not
occurred to any great extent, and on the whole they have
been very successful. It is, however, necessary to keep
the engine well lubricated, especially when the sleeves get
worn, as the oil prevents loss of gas by leakage past the
sleeves and piston. In Fig. <a href="#fig_31">31</a> the two sleeves have come
together in such a position that the ports coincide with
the exhaust ports cut in the cylinder walls and therefore
the exhaust is <i>full open</i>, and as the sleeves travel at times
in opposite directions quick opening and closing of the ports
is secured. The cylinder head is held down to the cylinder
casting by screws or bolts and can be readily detached
for cleaning or inspecting the interior of the cylinder. The
great objection raised against the sleeve valves is their
excessive weight and the unmechanical manner in which
they are operated.</p>

Petrol Engine.</p></div>
</div>

<p><b>The Camshafts and Eccentric Shafts.</b>—These are
usually made from the same material as the crankshaft
and machined from the solid bar, the projecting cams or
eccentrics being afterwards cut to the correct shape. In
the case of a camshaft it is very important that the shape
of the cams should be such that they lift the valves quickly
off their seats to the full extent of their opening (or <i>lift</i>),
keep them open for as long a period as desirable, and then
allow them to close quickly but without shock. Cams
which have straight sides are more in favour than those
with curved sides, but if the action of the cams is to be
theoretically correct the side of the cam should be curved
in such a manner that the valve is lifted at first with a
uniformly increasing speed and afterwards with a uniformly
decreasing speed, so that it will be at rest in its top position.
If this is not done the valve tappet may jump a little above<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
the cam each time the valve is
lifted. In Fig. <a href="#fig_33">33</a> the cam A
is intended for the <i>inlet</i> valve
and the cam B for the <i>exhaust</i>
valve, the essential difference
being that the exhaust valve
must be kept open longer than
the inlet valve, and therefore
the exhaust valve cam is the
wider of the two. The <i>timing</i>
of the inlet and exhaust valves
of an up-to-date engine may be
explained by considering the
crankpin circle as divided into 360 parts or <i>degrees</i>. If there
were no <i>lag</i> or <i>lead</i> in the opening of the valves, then they
would open when the crank was on its dead-centre and close
when the crank was on its dead-centre. The inlet valve would
open when the crank was on its top dead-centre and close
when it had reached its bottom dead-centre, this representing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
the <i>suction</i> stroke of the engine. Then would follow compression
and explosion, giving two strokes or one revolution
before the exhaust valve commenced to open. The
exhaust valve would then open when the crank was on
its bottom dead-centre and close when the crank reached
its top dead-centre corresponding to the completion of
the exhaust stroke. It is very important that the pressure
of the gases above the piston when it commences to
move upwards on the exhaust stroke should be as low as
possible, and this can only be secured by opening the exhaust
valve towards the end of the <i>explosion</i> or power
stroke, thus allowing the bulk of the gases to escape and
leaving the piston with little resistance to encounter on
its upward exhaust stroke. Therefore we give the exhaust
valve a <i>lead</i> of about 30 <i>degrees</i>, which means that
it begins to open when the engine crank is 30 degrees from
the bottom dead-centre on the downward explosion stroke,
and we give it a <i>lag</i> of about 5 degrees in closing. This
means that we keep the exhaust valve open until the crank
has moved 5 degrees over the top centre, so that we may
fully utilize the <i>momentum</i> of the gases to clear out the
cylinder or <i>scavenge</i> it. As the piston moves rapidly up
the cylinder on the exhaust stroke it pushes the gases in
front of it out through the exhaust opening, but when it
gets to the top of its stroke the piston stops and then comes
down again for the suction stroke, whereas the gases will
tend to keep on moving if they are not unduly restricted
in their passage through the exhaust system, so that we
can generally obtain some slight advantage by giving the
exhaust valve a small amount of <i>lag</i> in closing.</p>

<p>The pressure of the gases in the cylinder after the exhaust
valve closes will nearly always be a little above atmospheric
pressure, and therefore nothing is gained by opening the
inlet valve immediately the exhaust closes—we generally
allow an interval of 5 degrees, which means that the total
<i>lag of the inlet</i> valve is 10 degrees in opening, or the inlet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
valve does not begin to open until the crank has moved
10 degrees off its top dead-centre on the downward suction
stroke. At the end of the suction stroke the piston will
again come to rest before moving up on the compression
stroke, but the gases will continue to rush into the cylinder
from the carburettor owing to their <i>momentum</i> if we leave
the inlet valve open a
little longer, hence we
generally give it a <i>lag</i> of
20 degrees in closing,
which means that the
inlet valve does not close
until the crank has moved
20 degrees up from the
bottom dead-centre on
the compression stroke.</p>

<p>The camshaft requires
to be well supported in
bearings to prevent it from
sagging or bending under
its load. If the shaft
and the cams are not
made from nickel steel or
high-grade steel alloy,
they require to be case-hardened
(hardened on
the surface) to prevent
wear on the surfaces due
to the pressure of the
valve springs, which is considerable and may reach 100 lb.
per valve easily; the same applies to the rollers of the
tappets. When sleeve valves are fitted to the engine,
<i>eccentric sheaves</i> must be used instead of cams, as no
springs are employed. An eccentric sheave with its <i>strap</i>
and rod are shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_34">34</a>. The valve shaft or lay
shaft is shown at C, and the sheave with the hole bored<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
eccentrically is shown at A, and B is the combined eccentric
strap and rod. The pin D operates the sleeve valve,
giving it a reciprocating motion in a vertical direction,
the angular movement being taken up by the oscillation
of the rod about the pin D, which would be fixed
into the sleeve. Sometimes a groove is formed round
the periphery of the eccentric disc or sheave to keep the
strap in position and prevent end movement. As the
weight of the sleeves is very considerable, the pin D and
the eccentric rod must be well proportioned to prevent
breakage or
undue wear.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="pcap">Fig. 35.—A Pair of Timing Wheels.</p></div>
</div>

<p><b>The Timing
Wheels</b>.—As
there is
only one suction
stroke
and one exhaust
stroke
in every two
revolutions of
the engine
crankshaft, it
will be clear
that the camshaft or eccentric shaft must be driven at <i>half the
speed</i> of the engine crankshaft. This may be done by the use
of two <i>gear wheels</i> or wheels having teeth cut on their periphery,
such wheels when used for this purpose being called
<i>timing wheels</i>, because the positions of the cams on the camshaft
(or the eccentrics on the eccentric shaft) <i>relative</i> to the
engine crankshaft when the teeth of the timing wheels
are put into mesh determines the <i>timing</i> of the inlet and
exhaust valves, i.e., the instant at which they will open or
close. A pair of timing wheels is shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_35">35</a>. The
pinion A has twelve teeth and is keyed to the engine crankshaft,
but the wheel B, which is keyed to the valve shaft,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
has twenty-four teeth, and hence the valve shaft runs at
half the speed of the crankshaft. The wheels shown are
<i>spur</i> gears, and the teeth run straight across the rim of the
wheel; it is, however, quite common to find wheels with
curved or <i>helical</i> teeth, as these run quieter. Sometimes
when spur gearing is used, one of the wheels is made of
fibre and the other of steel, but when helical gears are
used the wheels are generally made from nickel steel of
high tensile strength. The finer the <i>pitch</i> of the teeth
(i.e. the distance between the centres of consecutive teeth)
the quieter the gears will run, but the question of strength
and the cost of production must also be considered. The
latest practice is to use a silent <i>chain</i> drive; this originated
with the introduction of the sleeve valve and eccentric
shaft. When chains are used for the timing wheels provision
must be made for taking up slack in the chain owing
to stretching of the links, and as this cannot be done in
the usual manner (by sliding the <i>sprocket wheels</i> further
apart) owing to the centres of the crankshaft and the valve
shaft being rigidly fixed by the bearings, a small jockey
pulley (with teeth on it similar to those on the chain sprocket
wheels) is provided attached to a short shaft or spindle,
which can be raised or lowered at will, and thus keep the
correct tension on the chain. The chain drive must be
more expensive and require more attention; moreover, it
cannot be so very much quieter in action than good well-cut
helical gearing.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="pcap">Fig. 36. and Fig. 37. Two Views of a<br />Crankchamber.</p></div>
</div>

<p><b>The Crankchamber.</b>—The crankchamber, as its name
implies, is the receptacle which contains and supports
the crankshaft and also the camshaft. It is generally
an aluminium casting, but frequently for commercial vehicle
engines the top portion is made of cast iron and the bottom
portion of sheet steel. In either case brass or gunmetal
bearings, often lined with white metal, are fitted for the
shafts to revolve in, and the engine cylinders are mounted
on the top of the chamber. Provision should be made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
on the sides and ends of the crankchamber for fitting the
<i>magneto</i> and <i>oil pump</i> and also the <i>water pump</i>, if required.
There must also be some form of housing or extension of
the chamber to enclose the timing wheels, and sometimes
the whole of the valve gear is contained within the crankchamber
to ensure proper lubrication for it and stop any
noise from it
reaching the
outside world.
It is also important
that
there should be
large inspection
openings fitted
with proper
oil-tight covers
and some provision
for easily
pouring large
quantities of
oil down into
the lower portion
of the
chamber. The
design of a
crankchamber
necessitates
careful forethought
to ensure
ample
provision for all the necessary attachments and fittings
and to secure the maximum accessibility of all parts.
One or two <i>vent</i> pipes, consisting of upwardly projecting
pipes having their outer end covered with wire gauze and
screened from dust should be provided to allow hot air
and gas to escape from the chamber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span></p>

<p>Two views of a crankchamber of modern design are shown
in Figs. <a href="#fig_36">36</a> and <a href="#fig_36">37</a>. In these figures A is the top half of
the crankchamber which rests upon the <i>chassis</i> or framework
of the car, being bolted to an <i>underframe</i> at B and C.
The cylinders are attached to the chamber at the flange H
by means of studs and nuts. This portion, the top half
of the crankchamber, requires to be very strong and stiff,
because the upward pressure of the explosions acts on
the crown of the cylinder and tends to tear the cylinder
off the flange H, while at the same time it exerts a great
force on the piston, pushing it downwards and tending
to force the crankshaft down out of its bearings. In the
best practice the whole weight of the crankshaft is supported
from the top half of the crankchamber and is carried
on the bearing bolts as shown at S, so that they also
receive the downward thrust of the piston and in their
turn transmit it to the main casting.</p>

<p>The bottom half of the crankchamber then becomes
merely an oil container, or reservoir, and dust cover; it
should be so arranged and situated that it may be readily
removed for inspection of shaft and bearings from underneath.
Sometimes the crankchamber has long arms, which
can be attached directly to the side members of the chassis,
or it may be supported in the chassis by a tubular cross
member.</p>

<p>In Fig. <a href="#fig_36">37</a> the camshaft is shown at T; the magneto
would be carried on the bracket E and driven by gearing
from the crankshaft. The facing at G is for the water
pump, which, in this case, is intended to be mounted on
an extension of the camshaft T. The oil pump would be
fixed at F, preferably towards the rear of the engine, so as
to secure an adequate supply of oil for the pump when the
car is climbing a steep hill. The oil could be drawn off
and the reservoir emptied by unscrewing the large plug
shown in the centre of D in Fig. <a href="#fig_36">37</a>. The timing wheel
housing or casing is shown at Q; the oil ducts and con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>nexions
for supplying the main bearings with oil are not
shown in these drawings, nor are the inspection openings
and covers. The upper half of the crankchamber frequently
becomes very hot, due to conduction of heat from the metal
of the cylinders, and for this reason it has from time to time
been proposed to draw the air supply of the carburettor
through the crankchamber to serve the dual purpose of
cooling the bearings and heating the air supply to the carburettor;
but the idea has not found favour, as there is
considerable risk of dust and grit finding its way into the
bearings and causing trouble due to abrasion.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />

<b>THE CARBURETTOR AND CARBURATION</b></h2>


<p>A carburettor is a contrivance for supplying an explosive
mixture of air and petrol vapour to a petrol engine. Petrol,
although a liquid fuel, is a combination of carbon and
hydrogen which, when supplied with the necessary air, can
be burnt and thus evolve heat, which heat is turned into
work inside the engine cylinder. What we have to supply
to the engine is really a mixture of <i>air</i> and <i>petrol vapour</i>
in certain proportions, such a mixture being often spoken
of as <i>carburetted air</i> on account of the carbon contained
in it. About two parts of petrol vapour (by volume) are
required to every one hundred parts of mixture, or fifteen
<i>pounds</i> of air to every pound of petrol vapour (by weight).
This carburetted air must be of the required strength and
form a homogeneous mixture in the form of a vapour.
The problem of <i>carburation</i> consists in forming a mixture
of the correct strength and character. Air may be carburetted
by passing it over the surface of liquid petrol in
a <i>surface carburettor</i>, or by drawing it over or among wicks
saturated with liquid petrol as in the <i>wick type of carburettor</i>,
but both these methods have been largely superseded
by the use of what is now known as a <i>jet</i> or <i>spray type</i> of
carburettor, in which the petrol is sprayed from a fine jet
and mixes with air which is passing up rapidly round the
outside of the jet. In all cases, however, the liquid petrol
must be <i>vaporized</i> before entering the engine, and to do
this <i>heat</i> must be supplied to the mixture, just as water
has to be heated before it can be vaporized and turned
into steam. Under ordinary circumstances sufficient heat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
can be obtained from the incoming air to effect vaporization
of the liquid petrol if it issues in the form of a very
finely divided spray, but when the demand for mixture,
from the engine, is great the
air cannot supply the requisite
heat without its
temperature falling below
the vaporization point;
hence most carburettors of
up-to-date pattern are fitted
with a <i>mixing chamber</i> surrounded
by a hot-water
jacket. The essential features
of the carburetting
plant are shown diagrammatically
in Fig. <a href="#fig_38">38</a>, in which
A is the <i>petrol tank</i> fitted
with the <i>petrol tap</i> G, to
which is coupled the <i>petrol
pipe</i> F. Some form of <i>petrol
filter</i> as indicated at B should
be placed between the tank
and the carburettor C. The
throttle valve of the carburettor
is
shown at H,
the <i>extra-air
valve</i> at E, and
the engine induction
pipe at

metal float which can slide freely up and down the needle
valve stem operates two levers which are pivoted on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
float chamber cover. It is well known that when a body
is immersed in a liquid the liquid exerts an upward pressure
on the body equal to the weight of liquid displaced
by the body. The float being hollow and made of very
thin sheet metal, displaces a very large quantity of liquid
in proportion to its own weight, and is therefore very <i>buoyant</i>.
The buoyancy of the float will, of course, depend on
the <i>density</i> of the liquid in the float chamber, and it will
naturally sink deeper down into petrol than it would into
a heavier spirit such as paraffin or benzol. The action of
the float is as follows:—Supposing the petrol to be turned
off and the needle valve lifted up off its seating, then on
turning on the petrol supply the petrol will run into the
float chamber, and as the level of the liquid rises the float
will rise too, lifting up the outer ends of the levers and depressing
the needle valve down on to its seating by means
of the collar which is rigidly attached to the spindle of the
needle valve. If at any time the level of the liquid in
the chamber falls, the float will fall also, thus allowing the
outer ends of the levers to drop and raise up the needle
valve from its seating; this allows more petrol to enter
the chamber and raises the float again, thus keeping a constant
level in the chamber.</p>

<p>The height of the orifice in the top of the petrol jet above
the bottom of the float chamber determines the height at
which we require the liquid to stand in the chamber. As
a general rule the level of the liquid in the float chamber
should be slightly below the top of the jet orifice to prevent
the liquid oozing over and causing <i>flooding</i> or continuous
dripping of petrol from the jet, even when the engine is not
running. The height of the collar on the needle valve
spindle must be adjusted until the float closes the valve
down on its seating when the liquid has risen to the desired
height in the float chamber. Hence, if a carburettor has
been adjusted to work with petrol, it will require to have
some slight extra weight added to the float when working<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
with heavier spirits to cause it to sink to the required depth
in these denser spirits.</p>

<p><b>The Petrol Jet and Choke Tube.</b>—The <i>petrol jet</i>
generally consists of a short tube of fine bore, one end of
which contains a very small orifice for the purpose of spraying
the petrol into the choke tube. When the engine is at
rest it is easily seen that the pressure of the air in the choke
tube is atmospheric, and that the pressure above the liquid
in the float chamber is also atmospheric, but when the
engine is running it draws air up the choke tube at a very
high speed and thus causes a partial vacuum round the
petrol jet, and therefore the petrol spurts out of the jet
under the pressure difference which then exists and issues
in the form of a fine spray which is readily vaporized.
The choke tube is purposely made of rather small diameter,
in order to get a high air speed, which results in a low pressure
round the jet and ensures a good driving force to
spray the petrol out of the jet. The speed of the engine
is controlled by the position of the throttle valve or disc E,
which regulates the amount of air flowing up the choke
tube, and therefore incidentally checks the quantity of
petrol issuing from the jet by regulating the vacuum in
the neighbourhood of the jet orifice. At low engine speeds
there is very little suction or vacuum effect on the jet, but
at high engine speeds with full throttle opening the maximum
suction of the engine is exerted upon the jet. Thus
at low speeds with this type of carburettor we do not get
enough petrol out of the jet, and at high speeds we get too
much, which results in <i>too weak</i> a mixture at low speeds
and <i>too rich</i> a mixture at high speeds. One reason for this
is that the air flows out of the choke tube <i>faster</i> than it
flows into it, owing to the fact that its volume increases
as the pressure decreases, and hence the pressure round
the jet falls very rapidly indeed as the air velocity increases
and causes too much petrol to issue from the jet in proportion
to the quantity of air flowing through the tube.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
The <i>choke tube</i> is often a plain piece of pipe, as shown in
Fig. <a href="#fig_40">40</a>, instead of being tapered as in Fig. <a href="#fig_39">39</a>.</p>

<p><b>The Mixing Chamber and Throttle Valve.</b>—The
throttle valve is usually a plain flat disc of metal mounted
on a spindle which can be rotated and thus regulate the
size of the air passage to the engine. It is placed above
the petrol jet and situated in the mixing chamber, which
is simply a short length of pipe (of the same bore as the
engine induction pipe) surrounded by a hot-water jacket,
the supply of hot water being drawn from the
engine cooling system. The heat from this
jacket should be sufficient to make up for the
fall in temperature that would otherwise result
due to the vaporization of the petrol as explained
above.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Recent Improvements in Carburettors.</b>—Another
defect of this simple type of carburettor
becomes apparent in the larger sizes
required for multi-cylinder engines. To pass
the requisite quantity of petrol to keep the
engine running at high speeds without creating
too great a suction effort and thereby hampering the engine,
necessitates the use of a jet of larger calibre, so that the
liquid is no longer <i>sprayed</i> but issues in the form of a
fine stream which is not readily vaporized. This has been
overcome by the use of <i>multiple-jet carburettors</i> which have
several jets each surrounded by its own choke tube, but all
controlled by one throttle valve and supplied from one common
float chamber. In this case the total cross-sectional area
of all the jet orifices together could be made sufficient to pass
the necessary quantity of fuel, but the bore of each individual
jet orifice would be comparatively small and spraying
would result as before. Another very successful device
is shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_41">41</a>, in which A is the petrol jet which, in
this case, has no special orifice and is surrounded by a larger
tube B containing small holes for the inlet of air and out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>flow
of petrol. As the petrol issues from
the jet it strikes against the pointed cone
on the end of the screw C, and is thus very
successfully <i>atomized</i> and broken into small
particles which can be readily vaporized.</p>

<p>There are several devices for keeping
the strength of the mixture constant at
all engine speeds irrespective of the amount
of vacuum in the choke tube. One of the
best of these is illustrated in Fig. <a href="#fig_42">42</a>, and
consists in the use of a <i>compensating jet</i>.
The main petrol jet A is of sufficient size
to supply the requirements of the engine
under full speed and with the resulting high
vacuum; it is fed directly from the float
chamber in the usual manner. The compensating
jet B surrounds the main jet and
is supplied with petrol through an orifice C,
so arranged that it offers a greater resistance to flow than
the passage up the centre
of the main jet. At all
engine speeds up to a
certain predetermined
maximum the compensating
jet will supply most
of the petrol, but as the
demand increases the
main jet will also begin
to supply, and simultaneously
the compensating
jet will commence
to go out of action owing
to its supply of petrol
becoming partly or wholly
exhausted due to the restriction
of the orifice C.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span></p>

<p>The simple jet-in-tube carburettor
has been greatly improved
by the addition of an
<i>automatic extra-air valve</i>, of
which a simple form is shown
in Figs. <a href="#fig_43">43</a> and <a href="#fig_44">44</a>. It consists
of a small mushroom type
valve A, with its seating B so
arranged that it can be screwed
into the induction pipe of the
engine. The valve is held up
against its seating by a light
spring C, so that at high engine
speeds when there is a good vacuum in the induction pipe
the pressure of the atmosphere will open the valve against
the tension of the spring and allow air to pass into the
induction pipe, thus reducing the amount of vacuum and
simultaneously weakening the mixture.</p>

<p>The points of a <b>good carburettor</b>:—</p>

<p>These may be set out in the following order—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1) Complete <i>atomization</i> and <i>vaporization</i> of the liquid
fuel at all engine speeds.</p>

<p>(2) The supply of an <i>adequate quantity</i> of gas of the <i>correct
proportions</i> with all throttle openings and at
all temperatures.</p>

<p>(3) Sufficient <i>mechanical strength</i>
and <i>durability</i> to withstand
road shocks and to ensure
freedom from breakdowns
without undue <i>weight</i> or
<i>complications</i>.</p>

<p>(4) Ability to continue working
correctly when the car is on
an incline or affected by
the camber of the highway.</p>

<p>(5) Moderate first cost.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span></p>

<p><b>Pressure Feed and Gravity Feed.</b>—In Fig. <a href="#fig_38">38</a> we
showed a gravity-fed system or one in which the petrol
is fed from the tank to the float chamber of the carburettor
by the action of gravity only. For this system to be successful
at all times the carburettor must be placed low
down to obtain a good <i>head</i> for the flow of petrol in the
connecting pipes, as there is a practical limit to the height
at which the petrol tank can be fixed. Also the pipes must
have a continuous run down towards the float chamber
to prevent air-locks in them, and they must be kept away
from the hot exhaust system. When all these points can
be secured this system is perfect. An alternative system
is to force the petrol into the float chamber by maintaining
an air pressure (of 2 or 3 lb. per square inch) on the surface
of the liquid in the petrol tank. With this arrangement
the carburettor may, if desired, be situated <i>above</i>
the level of the petrol tank in a more <i>accessible</i> position,
but it necessitates the fitting of a small <i>air pump</i> on the
engine and the use of a <i>hand air pump</i> for starting.</p>

<b>IGNITION AND IGNITION DEVICES</b></h2>


<p>We have already stated that the charge of explosive mixture
is ignited in the cylinder at the end of the compression
stroke by means of an electric spark. The electric
spark takes place as the result of an electric discharge
across the <i>gap</i> between the <i>electrodes</i> of the <i>sparking plug</i>.</p>

<p><b>The Sparking Plug.</b>—Two views of a typical sparking
plug are shown in Figs. <a href="#fig_45">45</a> and
<a href="#fig_46">46</a>, in which A is the <i>high tension</i>
electrode which is periodically
charged with electricity at high
voltage (or electrical pressure)
from a high tension magneto or
a high tension coil, and B<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>
are electrodes which, being in
metallic contact with the cylinders
and framework of the engine,
are thus at zero potential. The
electric discharge occurs across
the gap C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub> in the form of a
spark or flash. The electrode A
is heavily <i>insulated</i> from the metal
casing D of the sparking plug by
porcelain insulators E and F.
The locknuts G and H serve to
keep the plug gas-tight and hold
the several portions together
mechanically. The terminal K is
used for clamping the wire (or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
lead) which brings the supply of high tension
electricity. The high tension electric
current may be supplied either by (1) a
magneto machine or (2), a coil and accumulator
ignition system.</p>

</div>

<p><b>The High Tension Magneto.</b>—In Figs.
47, 48 and 49 we show a modern high
tension magneto suitable for a four-cylinder
engine. It consists of the stationary magnets
A, the driving spindle B, the high
tension electrode D, the high tension distributor
C, and the low tension contact
breaker E. The armature, condenser, and
distributor gear wheels are not shown in the
drawings, but are situated <i>inside</i> the machine
in the space between the high tension electrode
D and the low tension contact breaker
E. As the spindle B is rotated by gearing
driven from the engine crankshaft the arma<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>ture
attached
to it generates
a high
tension current
and a
low tension
current.
The high
tension current
passes
to the high
tension electrode
D and
thence across
the machine
to the carbon
brush H of
the high
tension distributor
C.
The low
tension current
passes
through the
platinum-tipped
contact
screws
F<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>2</sub> of the
low tension contact breaker. Twice during each revolution
of the armature these contacts are separated owing to the fibre
block attached to the bell crank lever G passing over the
stationary cams T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>; this constitutes the <i>make-and-break</i>
device for interrupting the primary current. The momentary
interruption of the primary current in this way causes a
very great increase in the electrical pressure (or voltage)
of the secondary or high tension current which is sufficient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
to bring about
the spark discharge
across
the gap between
the electrodes
of the
sparking plug.
Since there are
two of these
cams on the
low tension
contact breaker
it will be understood
that the
armature can
supply current
for two sparks
in every revolution
it makes.
If we bear this
fact in mind we
will have no
difficulty in determining
the
relative speeds
of the magneto
armature and the engine crankshaft for any type of
engine. A four-stroke engine requires one spark in every
two revolutions made by the crankshaft, so that a four-cylinder
engine of this type requires two sparks per revolution,
and the magneto armature must run at crankshaft
speed. A six-cylinder engine working on the four-stroke
cycle would require three sparks per revolution, but the
armature of the magneto only supplies two, therefore it
must be driven at one-and-a-half times the crankshaft speed.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="pcap">Fig. 49.—End View of a High Tension Magneto,<br />
showing the Earthing Terminal (P).</p></div>
</div>

<p>The high tension distributor consists of the carbon brush<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
H driven by gearing from the magneto armature and the
metal segments M<sub>1</sub>, M<sub>2</sub>, M<sub>3</sub>, M<sub>4</sub>, which are mounted in a block
of insulating fibre. There must be as many segments on
the distributor as there are cylinders on the engine, one
segment for each sparking plug; but the armature cannot
supply more than <i>two</i> sparks per revolution, and therefore
if the distributor has four segments it must be driven at
half the armature speed, and if it has six segments it must
be driven at one-third of the armature speed. Each metal
segment is electrically connected to a sparking plug lead
such as L<sub>1</sub>, L<sub>2</sub>, L<sub>3</sub>, L<sub>4</sub>. The high tension electrode D is
attached to a light carbon brush which presses on a gunmetal
collector ring at the high tension end of the armature
winding. A special terminal is provided at P, so that
when a wire is attached to it and connected to the frame
of the engine (usually through a switch) the low tension
windings are <i>short-circuited</i> or closed on themselves, and
the make-and-break has no effect, because there is always
the path through the switch until it is opened again. Under
these circumstances the voltage of the high tension circuit
is not sufficient to cause the spark discharge, and the ignition
is then said to be <i>switched off</i>. The instant at which the
spark occurs may be <i>advanced</i> or made earlier by moving
the rocker arm K, which carries the stationary cams T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>
<i>backwards</i>, whereas if it is moved <i>forward</i> the ignition is
<i>retarded</i> and occurs later in the stroke. <i>Normal</i> ignition
occurs when the lever is midway in its range of movement
and corresponds to the position of the piston when the
crank is on the top dead-centre, whereas advanced ignition
occurs just before the piston has completed the compression
stroke, and retarded ignition will take place after the
crank has passed the dead-centre and when the piston has
moved down a little on the power (or explosion) stroke.
Advancing the ignition increases the speed, and retarding
the ignition reduces the speed, except when the engine is
overloaded, and then it may pick up speed a little or run<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
better if the ignition is slightly retarded—but the exact
behaviour will depend on the temperature of the metal
walls and piston within the cylinder.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="pcap">Fig. 50.—An Ignition Coil, showing the Trembler Mechanism.</p></div>
</div>

<p>We have mentioned that normal ignition occurs when the
crank is exactly on the dead-centre and the piston at the top of
its stroke. If we set the magneto when the engine is at rest so
that ignition <i>ought</i> to occur on dead-centre when the arm K
is in its mid position the actual sparking will be <i>late</i> on
account of the <i>time lag</i> of the electric current. The current
takes time to flow and in that brief element of time the
crank has moved a few degrees off the dead-centre, at high
speeds. Hence the ignition <i>must be advanced</i> if the charge
is to be correctly fired when the engine is running fast.
If the ignition is too far advanced it will cause the engine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
to “<i>knock</i>,” especially under heavy loads. If the ignition
is <i>retarded</i> the charge is not fired at the commencement
of the stroke so that a portion of the power theoretically
available in the fuel is lost to exhaust at the end of the
stroke. Retarded ignition always causes overheating of
the exhaust system.</p>

<p>If the arm K is fixed mechanically in its mid position
so that the ignition can neither be advanced nor retarded,
we have what is known as <i>fixed</i> ignition.</p>

</div>

<p><b>An Ignition Coil</b> suitable for a single cylinder engine
is shown in Figs. <a href="#fig_50">50</a> and <a href="#fig_51">51</a>, in which A and B are the low
tension terminals and C is the high tension terminal. The
trembler blade is shown at D, with the adjusting screw F
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>and the platinum-tipped contacts G<sub>1</sub>, G<sub>2</sub>. The iron core
of the coil projects a little above the case, as shown at E
in Fig. <a href="#fig_50">50</a>. The strength and character of the spark may
be varied considerably by slightly screwing F up or down.
When current is supplied to the low tension terminals of
the coil it flows through the primary winding and magnetizes
the iron core, completing its circuit by passing across
the platinum contacts. When the trembler blade is attracted
to the iron core the primary circuit is broken by the
temporary separation of
the platinum contacts, and
therefore the magnetism
ceases, the trembler is
released, and the circuit
is completed again. Thus
the trembler blade is set
rapidly vibrating and
making and breaking the
primary circuit as long as
the roller attached to the
rotating arm H of the
low tension contact
breaker shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_52">52</a>
is in contact with the
metal segment K, and
this results in the production
of a <i>succession</i> of sparks at the sparking plug
which is connected to the terminal C of the high tension
winding. This is very useful especially when starting an
engine, but with modern high-speed engines the trembler
has only time to give one spark at high engine speeds, and
therefore the magneto has the advantage except for easy
starting. This has led to the introduction of <i>dual</i> ignition
systems, and in particular to that system in which the main
ignition is by magneto, but there is a supplementary coil
fitted to supply high tension current to the ordinary high
tension magneto distributor when the engine is at rest,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
the coil being cut out after the engine has got up speed.
But this has been largely superseded by the use of electric
motors for starting the engine, although the <i>magneto</i> is
still relied upon for the ignition of the charge in the cylinders.
The contact breaker and coil just described would be very
suitable for a single cylinder petrol engine, or a non-trembler
coil might be used in conjunction with a contact breaker
of the quick break type used on magnetos and illustrated
in Fig. <a href="#fig_48">48</a>. In the case of a multi-cylinder engine having
coil ignition we may use separate coils without a high tension
distributor, or a single coil <i>and</i> a high tension distributor
having as many segments as there are engine cylinders
and arranged similarly to the magneto distributor of Fig.
48. When no high tension distributor is fitted there must
be a separate coil for each cylinder, and the high tension
wire runs direct from the coil to the sparking plug, so that
the character of the spark as well as the exact instant at
which it occurs may not be the same in each of the cylinders.
If there is a high tension distributor it should be mounted
on the same driving spindle as the low tension contact
breaker, in order that the ignition may be <i>synchronized</i>, i.e.,
the spark will occur at the <i>same</i> point in the piston’s stroke
for all the cylinders. The ignition may be advanced or
retarded by moving the casing of the low tension contact
breaker relative to the roller arm, thus causing it to make
contact either earlier or later in the revolution.</p>

<p>At one time it was thought that <i>two-point ignition</i> gave
increased power and efficiency. Two-point ignition means
<i>simultaneous</i> firing of the charge from more than one plug.
Sometimes two high tension leads were led from each distributor
segment and connected to the two plugs in the
corresponding cylinder—this constituted the <i>parallel</i> system.
Another system employed a special plug with <i>both</i> electrodes
insulated from the engine frame; this was coupled in
<i>series</i> with an ordinary plug so that the spark jumped the
gaps in succession. It is quite evident, however, that if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
the gas is thoroughly mixed up and in a state of violent
agitation as the result of rapid compression, a single well-placed
spark will fire it successfully and so no gain results
from simultaneous ignition at another and less favoured
point.</p>

made on any one segment of the low tension contact breaker
connected to it. All the low tension terminals of the coils
are connected together to a common busbar, which is supplied
with current from the accumulator direct. The current
flows from the busbar through the low tension windings
of each of the coils in turn, as it comes into operation through
the engine-driven contact breaker, and returns to the battery
through the frame of the engine. High tension cables
lead from the high tension terminal of each coil direct to
the sparking plugs, and therefore the ignition is not necessarily
synchronized.</p>

<p>When the switch in the low tension circuit is opened the
ignition is <i>off</i>, because the current is then permanently
interrupted; when the switch is closed the ignition is <i>on</i>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
To economize current a quick make-and-break device should
be used instead of the <i>wipe</i> form of contact breaker illustrated,
and a non-trembler coil used. It is very important
to fully <i>retard</i> the ignition lever when starting an engine
having coil ignition, because it is very liable to backfire
and injure the operator’s wrist; with magneto ignition
this is less liable to happen.</p>

<p><b>Timing the Ignition.</b>—Various instructions are given
from time to time for correctly timing magneto ignition,
but the following will be found to give satisfactory results.
First ascertain the firing order of the cylinders as explained
above, and then bring No. 1 piston on to the top dead-centre.
Rotate the driving spindle of the magneto until the carbon
brush H of the high tension distributor makes contact on
the segment connected to the lead marked (1). If the
leads are not marked it will be necessary to determine
which is No. 1 by observing the direction of rotation of
the brush. Next adjust the position of the driving spindle
very carefully by turning it to and fro, so that when the
ignition lever K (see Fig. <a href="#fig_48">48</a>) is in its mid position the
platinum contacts F<sub>l</sub>, F<sub>2</sub> are fully separated, the brush
H still being on segment No. 1. Then push the magneto
gear wheel into mesh with the engine gear wheel which is
to drive it, and firmly bolt down the magneto to its bracket.
Similar instructions may be followed out for the coil ignition
system.</p>

<b>LUBRICATION</b></h2>


<p><b>Properties of Oils.</b>—Owing to the very high speed at
which the modern petrol engine runs great attention must
be paid to lubricating the moving parts, otherwise undue
wear or even <i>seizure</i> will result. We must be very careful
to choose a suitable oil, one which is chemically pure and
retains its lubricating properties at high temperatures. A
considerable amount of oil finds its way into the cylinder,
where it comes into direct contact with the hot gases. If
an oil is heated a temperature will sooner or later be attained,
when the oil will give off an <i>inflammable</i> vapour, i.e., one
which will burn. This temperature is called the <i>flash point</i>
of the oil. If the oil is likely to get into the cylinder of a
petrol engine it should have a very high flash point; in fact,
most of these oils do not flash until well over 400° Fahrenheit.
Also when the oil is burnt it must not leave any
appreciable residue. Some oils are very defective in this
respect, and leave large quantities of <i>carbon deposit</i> on the
metal walls of the cylinder and the valves; others again
are gummy or too <i>viscous</i> even at high temperatures.
Such oils must be avoided equally with those which lose
their <i>viscosity</i> too much under heat.</p>

<p><b>Splash System of Lubrication</b>.—One method of lubricating
the working parts is known as the splash system.
In this system oil is poured into the crankchamber and
the moving parts dip into it, splashing it all over the interior
of the crankcase and the lower portions of the cylinder
walls. Oil holes are drilled in such positions that as the
oil drops down again after being splashed upwards some of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
it will fall into these holes and lubricate the bearings. This
is a very cheap method of lubrication in <i>first cost</i>, but very
wasteful and unsatisfactory in regular use, hence it has
practically died out. As the oil is used up a fresh supply
must be admitted by some form of continuous drip-feed
arrangement, the oil being forced over very often from a
small tank on the footboard by means of air pressure or
the pressure of the exhaust gases from the engine. It is
very difficult under these circumstances to estimate how
much oil is present in the crankchamber at any given instant,
so that there was usually alternately too much or
too little. Too little oil meant undue wear on bearings
(perhaps seizure), and too much oil meant a smoky exhaust
which became very obnoxious when the engine was suddenly
accelerated.</p>

<p><b>Improved System of Splash Lubrication.</b>—This is
a combination of the splash system and the <i>forced</i> system,
and is shown in Figs. <a href="#fig_55">55</a> and <a href="#fig_56">56</a>. In these figures A<sub>2</sub> and A<sub>3</sub>
represent two of the main engine bearings which support
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>the crankshaft; C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>3</sub> are three of the crankpins; F<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>,
F<sub>3</sub> are oil troughs placed
under the crankpins; D<sub>2</sub>,
D<sub>3</sub> are oil feed pipes to the
main bearings. Generally
speaking, the oil is drawn
from the bottom of the
crankcase by means of a
pump, and this pump delivers
the oil to some form
of indicator mounted on the
dashboard of the car. After
passing through the indicator
the oil flows by two main
pipes, one of which feeds the
main bearings by means of branches D<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>3</sub>, etc., and the
other feeds oil troughs by means of branches such as G<sub>2</sub>.
When the troughs are <i>full</i> the oil overflows into the bottom
of the crankchamber, and so there is always a constant
depth of oil for the scoops attached to the connecting rod
ends to dip into, and one great drawback to the splash
system is overcome; also the main bearings are always
sure of being amply supplied. The oil pump may be an
ordinary plunger type pump or a rotary pump.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Forced Lubrication.</b>—One system of forced lubrication
is shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_57">57</a>. The general arrangement of the system
is very similar to the preceding one, except that there
are no troughs in the crankchamber and <i>all the bearings</i>
receive an ample supply of oil under <i>pressure</i> so that the
journals are supported in their bearings on a <i>film of oil</i> and
the metals never come in direct contact with each other.
After entering the main bearings the oil passes through holes
drilled in the crankshaft and thus positively lubricates the
crankpin bearing, passing up the connecting rod either internally
as shown or by an external pipe it lubricates the gudgeon
pin and then falls down into the crankchamber. On its way
down it gets splashed about and thus lubricates the cylinder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
walls and piston; sometimes these are positively lubricated
by leading the oil through the centre of the gudgeon pin
direct to the surface of the cylinder walls—but this often
gives an excess of oil and causes a smoky exhaust. In
Figs. <a href="#fig_58">58</a> and <a href="#fig_58">59</a> we show two views of a very popular form
of oil pump for forced lubrication systems. It consists
of two gear wheels, one of which is driven by a spindle from
the engine crankshaft, and it drives the second wheel by
means of the projecting teeth. The oil is picked up by
the teeth and passed round from the suction to the delivery
side of the pump on the <i>outer</i> edge of the wheels; no liquid
can pass direct across between the teeth which are in mesh,
and hence the direction of rotation is as shown by the
arrows.</p>

Two Views<br />of a Rotary Oil Pump for<br />Forced Lubrication.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The difficulty of securing
a really good lubricant
for petrol engines
must be apparent from a
study of the prices of the
various oils. It will be
observed that they are
all considerably more
expensive than petrol,
and therefore we must
economize in their use.
The old splash system
was very wasteful and
consumed oil at the rate
of one gallon every hundred
miles at least, but
a modern system of forced
lubrication will not require
more than one
gallon of oil every thousand
miles. Perhaps an
average everyday figure
for ordinary motor-car
engines would be one gallon every 250 miles. The pressure of
the oil in a forced feed system varies in different makes of
engines from 5 up to 40 pounds per square inch—a very
common figure, however, is 10 pounds per square inch. The
speed of the oil pump also varies considerably, and ranges
from 500 up to 2,000 revolutions per minute at normal engine
speed. Generally a small relief valve is fitted in the pump
casing, which returns oil to the crankchamber if the pressure
tends to rise above the desired limit due to the engine speed
increasing. We have mentioned already that the flash
point is generally over 400° Fahrenheit when the oil is
new, but after it has been in the crankcase some time and
got used over and over again it is found that the petrol<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
vapour leaking past the piston rings of the engine condenses
when the engine cools down after a run and drops into the
oil in the sump, thus lowering its viscosity and its flash point.
According to Mr. Morcom it may come down as low as
200° Fahrenheit (about), but if the oil is heated and the
petrol driven off the flash point goes up again. Therefore
it is a good plan with forced lubrication systems to empty
the old oil out periodically and fill up entirely with fresh
oil.</p>

<b>COOLING</b></h2>


<p>We have already explained the necessity for cooling the
cylinders of a petrol engine by means of a water-jacket,
and we now proceed to show how the circulation system
may be arranged.
There
are two forms
of circulation
in use: (1)
Natural; (2)
Forced.</p>

<div class="figright">
<a id="fig_60"></a>
<img src="images/i_069.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="pcap">Fig. 60.—Thermo-syphon Water Cooling
 System.</p></div>
</div>

<p><b>Natural or
Thermo-Syphon
Circulation.</b>—This
system
is shown in Fig.
60, and may be
explained as
follows:—The
heat generated
by the successive
explosions
within the
cylinder causes the water at the top of the cylinder
jacket A to get hot. As a column of hot water is lighter
than one of cold water of equal height, the heated water
rises up the pipe B and flows into the top of the radiator
D, while colder water from the bottom of the radiator flows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
up the pipe C and into the cylinder jacket A. It is important
that the height of the water in the radiator D should
be at such a level that the outlet from the pipe B is submerged.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="fig_61"></a>
<img src="images/i_070.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="pcap">Fig. 61.—Forced Water Circulation by means of a Pump (P).</p></div>
</div>

<p>In the radiator the water falls through a series of tubes
E, having <i>gills</i> or fins on the outside for the purpose of dissipating
the heat. The cooling of the water is also assisted
by the fan F, which is driven from the fan pulley G and
draws air past the radiator tubes at high speed. Sometimes
the water in the radiator is made to fall through a
series of cells which are formed of cast aluminium; such
a radiator is called a <i>honeycomb</i> radiator. It is important
that the pipe C should not have any sharp bends and it
should not rise very much in height, but the outlet pipe B
may have a considerable rise with advantage. Both the
inlet and outlet pipes should be of large diameter with
this system of circulation, and the radiator should be so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
arranged that there is a good <i>head</i> of water above the
cylinders. In the drawings H is the front cross-member of
the chassis, K is the starting-handle clutch, and L is the
starting handle.</p>

<p><b>Forced or Pump Circulation.</b>—With this system the
water is positively circulated through the jackets; it is drawn
from the bottom of the radiator by the pump P (Fig. <a href="#fig_61">61</a>),
which is mechanically driven from the valve shaft of the
engine, and delivered under pressure to the jacket A. The
outlet of the pipe B need not be drowned, and the pipe C
may be arranged in any way most convenient to the chassis.
Sometimes when a pump is fitted the pipes are arranged
so that the system may be operated as a thermo-syphon
in the event of a breakdown of the pump. It is not uncommon
to experience trouble due to leakage at the pump
gland, which results in gradual loss of water from the system,
and therefore the thermo-syphon or natural circulation
has much to recommend it. Also it may be said that the
pump represents an additional <i>complication</i> to the engine
and means increased first cost. Every moving part we
add to the engine is of course an additional potential source
of trouble, but the addition of a really first-class water
circulating pump of the type shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_58">58</a> cannot be
said to be anything but a reasonable precaution. The
weight and size of every part of a motor-car engine and
chassis have been so much reduced recently, owing to competition
with American firms, that many manufacturers
who adopted the thermo-syphon principle experienced
great trouble with it owing to the small size of radiator
fitted, as well as faulty arrangement of the connexions.
Considering any one engine, it follows that if a certain size
of radiator and a given quantity of water in the circulating
system will keep the engine cool when a pump is used to
give a positive circulation, then a larger radiator and greater
quantity of water will be required for natural circulation.
Thermo-syphon circulation also means a <i>high</i> radiator and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
bonnet, which many people object to on the score of appearance,
without considering its utility. With natural circulation
greater care must be exercised to keep the radiator
well filled, but this often leads to other difficulties on bad
roads owing to the water splashing from the overflow pipe
and finding its way on to ignition appliances. Before starting
an engine it is always advisable to remove the radiator
filling cap and examine the water level; if it should happen
that at any time while the engine is running the circulating
system runs quite dry, owing to a breakdown or leakage,
do not attempt to pour water into the radiator, but simply
raise both sides of the bonnet and leave the engine to cool
down first. Again, when filling the radiator for a forced
circulating system, it is desirable to give the engine a turn
or two with the starting handle occasionally to operate
the pump and prevent air locks; very often the radiator
appears to be full, but as soon as the engine commences to
run the water disappears owing to the system not being full,
due to the above-mentioned cause. In cold or frosty
weather all the water should be drained off from the circulating
system when the car is in the garage, unless the
garage is heated or some anti-freezing solution is used.
Glycerine or alcohol added to the water will prevent it
freezing, but as an additional precaution in cold countries
one often sees travelling rugs strapped over the radiator
and bonnet.</p>

<p>Occasionally one gets trouble due to the water boiling
in the jackets, and on this account reasonable care should
always be exercised in unscrewing the radiator filling cap
if the presence of steam is suspected. An engine may have
been running well for a long time without trouble and
then develop symptoms of overheating in the circulation
system. This overheating may be either <i>local</i> or <i>general</i>.
Local overheating may result from some partial seizure
of the piston in the cylinder due to dirt on the walls, or
from the presence of grease on the <i>outside</i> of the cylinder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
walls, in the jacket space. If grease is suspected or there
is <i>furring</i> up in the passages of the jacket due to bad water
supply, the trouble may be cured by adding some common
washing soda to the water in the radiator and running the
engine with the car at standstill for half-an-hour or so.
After this drain off all the water and sludge, allow the
engine to cool down, and then fill up again with clean water.</p>

<p>General overheating may result from leaky pistons and
pistons rings, or from the use of <i>too weak</i> a mixture in the
carburettor, or from overloading the engine. If the mixture
supplied to the engine is very weak, the overheating
will be very marked on the <i>exhaust side</i> of the engine. Local
overheating causes the engine to “<i>knock</i>” badly.</p>

<p>In arranging the jackets and the pipes care must be
taken to arrange that a cock is placed at the <i>lowest</i> point
in the system, so that the whole may be completely emptied,
and the inlet pipe to the jacket should enter at the very
bottom of the jacket chamber for the same reason. It
may be thought that all that is necessary is to provide
plenty of space in the jackets round the cylinders and
plenty of water in the whole system, but experience shows
that it is very important not to make the jacket space <i>too
large</i>, so as to ensure positive circulation and avoid <i>local
circulation</i> in any one portion of the jacket. When cylinders
are cast in pairs the back pair have a tendency to
discharge their hot water into the front pair and so back
to the inlet pipe again, hence this should be guarded against
in arranging the outlet pipes.</p>

<p>Pipes suitable for use with multi-cylinder engines are
shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_62">62</a>, in which (<i>a</i>) is an outlet pipe for a monobloc
casting, and (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) are inlet and outlet pipes respectively
for engines having separate cylinders. It is
advisable to modify the diameter of the branches by the
insertion of metal orifice plates at the flanges to ensure an
equitable distribution of the water among the several
cylinders.</p>

</div>

<p>The weight of water carried
in the circulation
system for a fifteen horse-power
engine would be
about 30 lb. with pump
circulation, whereas 60 lb.
would be required for
thermo-syphon cooling. It
is not desirable to cool the
engine too much. The
jacket water temperature
may be allowed to reach
180° Fahrenheit at full load,
but if this is exceeded there
is liability to boiling. Given
two similar engines of equal
power and equally loaded,
one of which was operated
with a jacket temperature of
100° Fahrenheit and the
other at 180° Fahrenheit,
the hotter engine would show a gain in economy of from
five to ten per cent. in fuel consumption. In considering
the type of radiator to adopt, one would not recommend
the honeycomb variety (except for appearance) owing to
the difficulty of cleaning the passages after it has been in
use some time; and the gilled tube would be more efficient
than the plain tube. The amount of tube required depends
of course on its diameter, but a rough approximation would
be twelve feet of gilled tube or eighteen feet of plain tube
(of half-inch diameter) per brake horse-power.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />

<b>THE POINTS OF A GOOD ENGINE</b></h2>


<p><b>Choosing the Number of Cylinders.</b>—It is a very
difficult problem to select the <i>best</i> engine for a particular
purpose, as there are so many factors which influence one’s
choice. A single cylinder engine would only be used for
a motor-cycle or a small car of low power; the vibration
and noise resulting from the use of a single cylinder petrol
engine of even six horse-power are most objectionable, and
difficulties of starting and risk of engine unexpectedly
pulling up and stopping are greatly enhanced. The two-cylinder
engine offers better prospects, and was for some
time considered quite good enough for most purposes,
but owing to its <i>comparatively</i> bad balance and its low
torque it has fallen into disfavour. We have seen how
the rotating parts of the engine can be balanced, but we
have not considered the reciprocating parts. To understand
this question of balancing we must talk about “<i>inertia
forces</i>.” All bodies possess inertia, that is, they resent
changes in their state of rest or motion. If a body is moving
uniformly it tends to keep on doing so, whereas if it
is at rest it tends to remain so. To start the body off
from rest, or to stop the body and bring it to rest, requires
a <i>force</i> to be exerted, and this force may be called the <i>inertia
force</i>. When a petrol engine is running at high speed the
piston has to be started and stopped at the top and bottom
of its stroke every time the crankshaft revolves once, and
to do this very large forces are needed, because it has to
be done so quickly. These inertia forces take the form<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
of pushes or pulls on the shaft and framework of the engine,
and thus cause <i>vibrations</i> to be set up. If the periodicity
or <i>frequency</i> of these forced vibrations happens to coincide
with the natural period of vibration of the shaft material
the shaft will commence to <i>whip</i>, and may possibly break
under the excessive strain. In a two-cylinder engine with
cranks 180 degrees apart (or half a revolution) one
piston is moving upwards and the other piston is moving
downwards, both at very high speed; and both have to
be brought to rest when the cranks come on their respective
dead-centres. The piston which is moving up tends
to lift the shaft up with it, and the one which is moving
down tends to pull the shaft down with it, because the
connecting rods check the progress of the pistons and bring
them to rest at the top and bottom of their strokes. If
these two pulls acted in line with each other they would
<i>balance</i>, but the cylinders are usually mounted side by side,
and then the two pulls virtually act at the ends of a bar
whose length is the longitudinal distance between the
vertical centre lines of the two cylinders. Thus these
two inertia forces tend to rotate the whole engine first in a
clockwise direction and then in a counter-clockwise direction,
according to which piston is moving up or down. The
only way to balance these forces under these conditions
is to extend the crankshaft longitudinally and place another
pair of cylinders and cranks in line with the first, but so
arranged that the inertia forces tend to turn the engine
in the opposite direction to the first pair. This gives us
the well known four-cylinder arrangement so much in
evidence at the present time, the arrangement of cranks
being shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_21">21</a>. A six-cylinder engine gives <i>perfect
balance</i> if all the parts are of equal weight, and the cranks
at 120 degrees to each other in opposed pairs.</p>

<p>Again, a single-cylinder engine gives one power stroke
in every two revolutions of the shaft, a two-cylinder gives
a power stroke in every revolution, a four-cylinder gives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
two power strokes, and a six-cylinder gives three power
strokes in every revolution of the shaft. Hence a six-cylinder
engine is very <i>flexible</i> (i.e., can accommodate itself easily
to varying loads), is perfectly balanced, and can be made
both powerful and economical. One objection to the use
of engines with multiple cylinders (exceeding, say, <i>four</i>
in number) is that the crankshaft is more liable to vibrate
and cause very harsh running at high speeds on account
of the fact that the <i>periodicity of the power impulses</i> imparted
to the shaft approaches the natural period of vibration of
the shaft. This effect arises from <i>torsional</i> oscillations and
is distinct from the <i>periodicity due to inertia forces</i> which
acts in the vertical plane. A four-cylinder engine is nearly
as good as a six-cylinder of equal power, and is of course
much cheaper in first cost, takes up less room, and weighs
less. A good four-cylinder engine will often prove more
economical in running costs than a six-cylinder, as it will
probably be running a greater length of time at or near
its full output, and the work done on the idle strokes of the
cycle will be less owing to the smaller number of cylinders.</p>

<p>Another feature to consider is the <i>arrangement</i> of the
cylinder castings. A monobloc casting (cylinders all in
one casting) gives a very short engine and reduces the
length of the crankshaft, but in the event of one cylinder
bore being damaged the advantage lies with the separate
cylinder construction.</p>

<p><i>The Question of the Valves.</i>—The question as to which
is the better engine, the sleeve valve or the poppet valve,
cannot be said to have been definitely decided yet. The
great feature of the poppet valve used to be its very quick
opening and closing, but nowadays engines turn over so
fast that very strong springs are needed to close the valves
in a reasonable time. One complete revolution of the
engine means that the crank has turned through 360
<i>degrees</i>, and the inlet valve is open while the crank turns
through 190 degrees (on the average), but during part of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
this time it is <i>being</i> lifted or <i>opened</i>, and during an equal
period it is <i>being closed</i>. The question then is, “How long
does it remain <i>fully open</i>?” The answer is—not more
than ten degrees at the most! To keep the inlet valve
open longer than this would require excessively stiff springs
and throw a great strain on the valve gear. Now this is
where the sleeve valve managed to get a look in—as one
might say. With <i>two</i> sleeves moving in opposite directions,
or one sleeve receiving a special form of motion, we
can open and close the ports and keep them fully open
for just as long period or even longer than the poppet valve.
If it were not for the fact that sleeve valves are heavy and
not so easy to keep gas-tight as poppet valves, it is perfectly
obvious that the poppet valve would have disappeared
or taken second place long before this.</p>

<p>Another great advantage of the sleeve valve is that by
making large ports we can easily secure larger valve openings
than are possible, for practical reasons, with a poppet
valve. It is now claimed also that the interior of the cylinders
keeps free from carbon deposit much longer with sleeve
valves than with poppet valves, this carbon deposit being
due chiefly to the use of too rich a mixture which causes
the combustion to be imperfect and results in the deposit
of solid carbon on the walls and sides of the combustion
chamber. <b>Carbon deposit</b> is also caused by using unsuitable
lubricating oil, but it principally arises from the
use of too rich a mixture for the purposes of securing quick
acceleration. <i>Perfect</i> combustion is only secured by the
use of a relatively <i>weak</i> mixture, which would prevent the
maximum power being developed and give rather a feeble
acceleration. Modern engines have to be very carefully
designed to reduce this nuisance of the carbon deposit to
a minimum, and also with a view to its speedy and efficient
removal when it does take place. Detachable cylinder
heads have been introduced principally to allow of rapid
removal of carbon deposit from pistons and valves and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
the combustion chamber. If the carbon deposit is allowed
to accumulate, <i>pinking</i> or sharp knocking commences, due
to pre-ignition of the charge by red-hot particles of carbon.
This results in loss of power, and is first noticed by inability
to climb steep hills that were formerly negotiated with
ease. Mention must also be made of the great claim for
<i>silence</i> of running of sleeve valve engines, and this is thoroughly
justified with <i>high-class engines</i> of the sleeve valve
type, provided they are in the hands of skilled drivers.
In unskilled hands one finds that the poppet valve is safer,
and will stand more knocking about without much increase
in noise resulting. Rotary valves have fallen into
disuse on account of the difficulty of keeping them gas-tight.
There is nothing to choose between poppet and sleeve valves
on the score of economy in running.</p>

<p><b>Economy and Durability.</b>—A good modern petrol
engine of reasonable size—say over 3 in. bore—will give
one brake horse-power for an hour from the consumption
of two-thirds of a pint of petrol. This means that an
engine giving 12½ horse-power on the brake would use a
gallon of petrol every hour. But economy in petrol consumption
is not the only desirable feature of a petrol engine.
There must be economy in lubricating oil and in cost of
replacements or repairs. Nowadays the tendency with
high grade steel alloys and other modern metals of high
strength and durability is to cut everything down to its
minimum size with a view to reducing <i>the cost of production</i>.
This often leads to many serious troubles in running on
the road. In choosing an engine one should carefully
examine such points as provision for wear and adjustment,
strength and rigidity, and whether the engine impresses
one with a sense of its <i>durability</i> and also its general <i>accessibility</i>.</p>

<b>TWO-STROKE ENGINES</b></h2>


<p>In the two-stroke type of petrol engine the cycle of operations
is completed in two working strokes of the piston
instead of the four required by the “Otto” cycle; there is
thus one explosion or power stroke in every revolution of
the crankshaft. Theoretically this represents a great advance
over the “Otto” cycle, but difficulties and complications
arise in the practical carrying out of the cycle. The
cycle on which it is desired to operate the engine is:
<i>1st stroke</i>—Compression; <i>2nd stroke</i>—Explosion. The
charge would be introduced on the compression stroke and
exhausted towards the end of the explosion stroke.</p>

<p>Now the charge of gas required by the engine consists
of a mixture of petrol vapour and air, and it must either be
sucked in or pushed in under <i>pressure</i>. In the “Otto” cycle
the charge is <i>sucked</i> in, and in the two-stroke cycle it is
delivered to the cylinder under <i>pressure</i>; hence in the two-stroke
cycle some form of pump is required which will suck
in the charge of air and gas, compress it a small amount,
and deliver it to the working cylinder at a pressure of 5 or
6 lb. per square inch above atmospheric pressure. This
is where the complications commence; if we fit a separate
pump for each cylinder, which is what would generally be
done, or if we made one pump serve for two cylinders, we
have to provide pump cylinders, pistons, rods and valves,
and therefore there is practically no gain over the four-stroke
engine. Hence it is that inventors all try to avoid
the use of a separate charging pump and turn their atten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>tion
to the production of an engine in which one or more
of the existing portions is made to serve as a pump for
charging the working cylinder or cylinders with gas. A
favourite and fairly successful device is to make the crankchamber
gas-tight and use it as the cylinder of the pump,
the underside of the engine piston then forming the pump
piston which
draws the
charge from
the carburettor
into the crankchamber
on its
upstroke and
compresses it
on its downstroke,
delivering
it to the
working cylinder
through the
inlet port as
soon as the
piston has uncovered
it by
its downward
movement.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="pcap">Fig. 63.—Two Port Type of Two-Stroke<br />
Engine with Crankcase Compression.</p></div>
</div>

<p>There is <i>no
exhaust valve</i>,
as the piston
uncovers the
exhaust ports a little before the inlet ports are opened.
To prevent the new charge escaping directly across the
top of the piston from the inlet ports to the exhaust
ports, a deflector is fitted on the top of the piston equal
in height to the height of the exhaust opening and situated
immediately in front of and facing the inlet ports.</p>

<p>A two-stroke engine of the type referred to is shown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
diagrammatically in Fig. <a href="#fig_63">63</a>. E is the gas-tight crankchamber,
upon which the water-cooled cylinder A is mounted
in the usual manner and fixed by studs or bolts. The
piston P carries the deflector H, which is equal in height
to the height of the exhaust opening G. The piston rings
are prevented from turning by pins so arranged that the
joint of the rings does not pass across the ports. The
connecting rod D is of usual form, and also the crankshaft
C. The carburettor, or induction pipe leading from the
carburettor, would be attached to the flange L, and the
automatic valve F controls the admission of gaseous
mixture from the carburettor to the crankchamber. The
inlet ports N are often only half the height of the exhaust
ports. On the upstroke of the piston a partial vacuum
will be formed in the air-tight crankchamber, which will
allow the atmospheric pressure to force open the valve F
against the pressure of the spring and enable the air to
flow into the crankchamber through the carburettor and
induction pipe, carrying the charge of petrol vapour with
it. We must note, however, that no vacuum can be formed
until the port N has been covered up by the piston, so that
a portion of the stroke is <i>idle</i>. On the downward stroke
of the piston the charge in the crankchamber is compressed,
and as soon as the piston uncovers the ports N
the charge from the crankchamber flows up into the
working cylinder, displacing the burnt gases as it comes
into the cylinder. Exactly what happens next it is
difficult to say; the probability is that this new charge
rises in the cylinder a short distance (but not a sufficient
amount to displace all the dead gases from the top end
of the cylinder) and that some of it gets squeezed out of
the exhaust opening as the piston rises and before it has
had time to cover the exhaust ports. Thus, owing to the
idle portion of the stroke during admission to the
crankchamber and to the low compression pressure
adopted in the crankchamber, the pumping portion of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
the engine has what is termed a very low <i>volumetric
efficiency</i>.</p>

<p>It can be proved that this type of engine which endeavours
to draw sufficient gas to fill its working cylinder into
the crankchamber by means of a piston having only the
<i>same</i> diameter as the diameter of the working cylinder
itself, and which cannot avoid some idle movement during
the operation together with further loss from the exhaust
opening, is incapable of retaining more than a little over
one-half a cylinder full of fresh combustible gas at the
instant when compression commences; the remainder
of the contents must be dead exhaust gas. Thus, even
allowing for the double number of power impulses resulting
from the use of the two-stroke cycle, it is difficult to see
how this form of engine could ever give more than about
one and a quarter times the power of a four-stroke engine
having the same bore and stroke even when the many
difficulties experienced in the practical working of two-stroke
engines have been overcome. To use a high compression
pressure in the crankchamber would increase
the volumetric efficiency, but would result in lost work
during the pumping process, besides being undesirable
at the delivery stage of the process; it is much better for
the transfer of the gases to take place as gently as possible.
If too high a delivery pressure is used the fresh gas will
enter in a sharp gust and get badly contaminated by mixture
with the foul exhaust products instead of gently displacing
them in bulk. The use of an automatic valve is
very desirable for the gas inlet to the crankchamber, but
unfortunately it limits the speed of the engine and also
its <i>flexibility</i> or ability to pull well at all speeds. An engine
with an automatic valve runs best at that speed for which
the tension of the spring is most suitable. If the spring
is weak the speed will be low. Tightening the tension on
the spring will allow the engine to speed up, but will prevent
it running well at low speeds. At high speeds and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
with correspondingly high tension the valve does not give
enough opening, and therefore limits the power of the engine.
It will, therefore, readily be seen that when a two-stroke
engine with automatic inlet valves is pitted against a four-stroke
engine with mechanically-operated inlet valves,
the comparison is unfair to the two-stroke cycle. With
the position and arrangement of ports shown in the drawings,
one must have a deflector on the piston head to prevent
excessive loss of fresh gas through the exhaust opening.
After the engine has been running for some time
at a high speed this deflector becomes very hot, and as a
general rule the cooling effect of the incoming gases is not
sufficient to prevent it attaining a <i>red heat</i> on the compression
stroke, thus igniting the charge before the piston
reaches the top of the stroke. This defect, which is called
<i>pre-ignition</i>, causes the engine to <i>knock</i>, and results in a loss
of power; it may be partly overcome by admitting lubricating
oil with the charge, the oil then serving to cool the
deflector as the charge enters the cylinder. At high engine
speeds there is great risk of the hot exhaust gases in the
working cylinder setting fire to the incoming charge in
the inlet ports, thus causing <i>backfiring</i> into the crankchamber.
To avoid all possibility of backfire, some form of <i>air
scavenging</i> must be adopted, but the general arrangement
of this form of two-stroke engine does not lend itself to
such an addition—it would merely reduce still further the
quantity of gas reaching the cylinder.</p>

<p>A difficulty that is peculiar to multi-cylinder engines
of the two-stroke type arises from the use of open exhaust
ports. The several cylinders generally discharge their
exhaust gases into a common exhaust pipe or box, so that
if one cylinder happens to be <i>missing</i> fire the exhaust from
another cylinder may set fire to the wasted charge—this
is usually referred to as <i>flashing-back</i> from the exhaust
and results in irregular and spasmodic knocking. It will
be clear from the foregoing that this cycle of operations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
which is so attractive from the theoretical point of view,
is not by any means so encouraging from the practical
standpoint, as many inventors have discovered. The difficulties
and failures of the early inventors which were so
discouraging for them have only encouraged their successors
and spurred them on to further efforts. After a
time the attempt to produce a <i>simple</i> two-stroke engine
was abandoned generally, and inventors turned their attention
to improved forms of two-stroke engines, some of
which were very costly and complicated, and none of which
have survived for motor-car purposes.</p>

<p>The writer of this volume became interested in the
problem of the two-stroke in connexion with one of these
inventions for an improved engine, and at a later stage
patented and designed an improved engine of the two-stroke
<i>air scavenging</i> variety, which by that time had become
a recognized type of two-stroke engine. This engine was
constructed and exhibited at one of the motor shows held
in London some years ago. A vast amount of experimental
and research work was carried out on it by the writer,
but the work had to be abandoned when incomplete owing
to the Syndicate which financed the venture having exhausted
its resources. The promoters of the Syndicate
were anxious to produce an engine that would give <i>double</i>
the power of a four-stroke engine, but their early attempts
were not at all successful. One of their four-cylinder engines,
which would have been rated at 35 horse-power on
the four-stroke cycle, only gave 12 brake horse-power when
tested by the writer. The engine designed by the writer,
which we may call the Kean two-stroke engine, would have
been rated at 25 horse-power on the four-stroke cycle, and
gave approximately 35 brake horse-power. Although
this result was excellent, so much advance had been made
in the four-stroke engine that it did not quite come up
to the best results obtained on that system, and hence we
were unable to show any marked advantage to be gained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
from its adoption. My experiments clearly pointed out
the road to further success, but owing to the partial failure
of my attempt to beat the four-stroke engine we could
not influence sufficient capital to reorganize and reconstruct
the Syndicate. My engine had not been designed
to secure a high speed of rotation but rather for strength
and durability, but it exceeded my expectations by turning
up to 1,500 revolutions per minute. The four-stroke
had, however, got well ahead of me by that time, and 2,000
was becoming common for it, hence I was heavily handicapped
in the race for horse-power.</p>

 Two-stroke Engine operates with Air Scavenging.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A description of my engine will probably prove of interest.
To understand the principle of the engine we must
turn to the diagrammatic sectional view of Fig. <a href="#fig_64">64</a>. Instead
of using the crankchamber of the engine as a gas
pump, this type of engine has a <i>duplex</i> piston, and the pump
chamber is formed by an annular extension of the main
engine cylinder. At first sight one would say this resulted
in a very high engine, but as a matter of fact the increase
in height is not more than about 25 per cent. in the cylinders,
and there is no difference in the crankchamber height
to that of a four-stroke engine. The outstanding feature
of the invention is the provision of a pump piston of larger
effective diameter than the main piston and the arrangement
of transfer pipes by which one pump feeds its neighbour’s
power cylinder, and <i>vice versa</i>. These are the basis
of the invention, and were being used a long time before
the writer had even heard of this type of engine, but it was
left for him to seize upon their capabilities and correctly
proportion the area of the annulus with respect to the main
engine piston. A careful study of the two-stroke problem
revealed the inherent defect of the <i>low volumetric efficiency</i>
and the tremendous possibilities of having an unlimited
volume for the pump chamber by simply increasing the
area of the lower or annular piston. Then followed the
writer’s attempt to tackle the outstanding practical diffi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>culties
enumerated above. The engines already employed
<i>air scavenging</i>, but could not really use it effectively until
proper proportions had been fixed upon for the respective
pipes, valves, and ports. The cycle of operations is as
follows:—On the downstroke of No. 1 piston the annular
portion draws a charge of gas from the carburettor into
the annular chamber D<sub>1</sub> (Fig. <a href="#fig_64">64</a>) through the inlet valve
B<sub>1</sub> and at the same time pure air is drawn into the transfer
pipe by the valve A<sub>2</sub>. On the upstroke the charges of
air and gas are compressed into the transfer pipe, and as
soon as the piston P<sub>2</sub> uncovers the inlet ports the air and
gas enter the working cylinder. In my engine I used a
relatively high compression pressure for the transfer of
the charge and curved the inlet ports up towards the head
of the cylinder as shown. The head of cylinder I made
curved, and the exhaust ports were carefully rounded and
curved also. The deflector on the head of the piston I
inclined, to curl the gases back against the wall of the cylin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>der,
and I reduced the height of the deflector to that of
the <i>inlet</i> port (instead of the exhaust port). My ultimate
aim was to abolish the deflector entirely by suitably shaping
the inlet ports, and I estimated that the path of the
gases would be in the direction of the arrows. The object
of raising the compression pressure in the lower cylinder
was twofold. First of all I aimed at an increase of volumetric
efficiency there, and secondly I hoped to propel
the scavenging air and the new charge right up to the
head of the cylinder and so clear out all the dead gases.
Then by suitably curving the head of the cylinder I expected
to compel the scavenging air to keep going ahead
of the gaseous mixture and curl round and down, then
following the exhaust gases out of the exhaust port.</p>

<p>My efforts in this direction were very unfortunately
frustrated to a large extent by the fact that the cylinders
of my engine had already been cast before I fully realized
the <i>tremendous</i> importance of <i>curving the cylinder head</i> and
giving a very <i>steep inclination</i> to the inlet ports. We did
our best to rectify matters in the machining and finishing
stages, but any engineer will understand the limitations
now imposed upon us. It was impossible to get new
cylinders cast owing to lack of time and funds, as we were
intending to exhibit the completed engine. Thus I cannot
say that my ideas were ever given a really satisfactory
test; the inlet ports <i>were</i> curved and inclined and the
cylinder head <i>was</i> rounded off, but not to such an extent
that I can feel certain no further improvement could ever
be made in those directions. Other improvements which
I introduced were an improved automatic inlet valve for
the gases, which was fitted inside the induction pipe and
whose spring tension could be adjusted while the engine
was running without letting any air leak into the induction
pipe; also an improved air scavenging valve, which could
be set to give the full amount of air to the engine and yet be
controlled from the dashboard of the car to give any desired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
quantity of scavenging air from <i>no air</i> up to <i>full air</i>. <i>Very</i>
large inlet valves were fitted, but when indicator diagrams
were eventually obtained from the engine they showed
that they were not nearly large enough and that the carburettor
opening was too restricted, thus cutting down
the power (and very likely the speed) of the engine by
probably over 25 per cent. High tension magneto ignition
was fitted and thermo-syphon cooling. Arrangements
were made to carry 80 lb. of water in the system, so that
the engine never showed any tendency to boil even when
the car had been running for long periods on the low gear.
A pump was afterwards fitted, but it did not effect
the cooling of the water any better than the natural
circulation, which was quite satisfactory. The range of
speed was from 150 revolutions per minute up to 1,500
revolutions per minute; the lower figure is very good
indeed, and can be attributed to the large number of
impulses obtained due to the two-stroke cycle. At the
highest speed the crankshaft received 6,000 impulses
per minute, or equivalent to a four-stroke engine running
at 3,000 revolutions per minute. The effective pressure
in the cylinder was, however, only just over 40 pounds per
square inch, due to the throttling at inlet already explained.
In a four-stroke engine we would expect just double that
figure. The extraordinary thing about this was that,
under heavy load, when the speed was brought down to
about 300 revolutions per minute, the effective pressure
had risen to nearly 200 lb. per square inch, but this
appears to be due to imperfect scavenging (or cleansing)
of the cylinder under these conditions.</p>

<p>The question of silencing the exhaust from the engine
had caused me some difficulty in the earlier experiments,
so that I now tackled this problem and designed a special
form of silencer in which the gases were first expanded to
remove their pressure and then afterwards their velocity
was taken up without shock. This answered so well that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
a <i>cut-out</i> made no difference whatever, and on taking
diagrams with the optical indicator I discovered that the
exhausting process was divided into equal periods of slight
pressure and slight vacuum with an average of zero pressure
(just atmospheric). We have seen in the earlier part of
this chapter how the fitting of automatic inlet valves is
liable to hamper the engine and reduce its flexibility, and
this impressed me very much with the earlier engines so
that at one time I adopted dual springs for the inlet valves.
These springs were mounted one above the other, the lower
one being much stiffer than the upper one. The idea of
the invention was that the weak springs would serve for
slow running and all loads up to <i>say</i> half the lift of the
valve, and then the stiffer springs would secure correct
action at high speeds. Further than this, I had them all
coupled on a bar which was controlled from the driver’s
seat, and by means of which I could cut out the weaker
springs or reduce their effect at will. It certainly answered
well in the older engines, but my new engine, shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_65">65</a>,
was so satisfactory that I abandoned the idea. About
five different systems of lubrication were experimented
with and many lubricating oils. Finally, forced lubrication
was employed for all the bearings and a drip sight-feed
for the pistons.</p>

</div>

<p>Much trouble was caused at one time in the new engine
by <i>knocking</i> of various kinds, and many hours were spent
in locating these troubles and curing them. The first
kind of knocking was most violent and almost made one
hold one’s breath in anticipation of seeing parts of the
engine go skywards. This turned out to be partial seizure
of a piston owing to a hard spot in the cylinder. After
curing this, general knocking from all cylinders began,
and was found to result from worn gudgeon pins. These
had been mild steel and case-hardened; they were discarded
for <i>Ubas</i> steel of slightly larger diameter, and this
trouble disappeared. Then <i>pre-ignition</i> was discovered. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
the magneto was switched off the engine slowed
down and nearly stopped, then began to run on again, knocking
and hammering in a most diabolical manner. All
cylinders were taken off again, all parts ground up, and
corners well rounded off, but still it continued. At first
it seemed to be due to the deflectors, but on several very
careful examinations (which of course meant dismantling
the whole engine every time and removing the cylinders)
no trace of overheating or burning could be found on these
or anywhere else in the interior of the cylinder. Then
the trouble was traced to the electrodes of the sparking
plugs. This was followed by two or three weeks’ con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>tinuous
experiments on fitting different types of plugs, and
the same type of plug was tried in four different positions
inside the cylinder. Then the device of fitting the plugs
to an adapter and so keeping them at the top of a small
hole instead of projecting into the cylinders was tried.
They still showed signs of overheating, and strange to say
no loss of power or flexibility was noticeable. Finally,
I fitted a water tank on the dashboard and allowed the
engine to suck water into the induction pipe while it drew
its mixture from the carburettor in the usual manner. I
had previously fitted separate drip-feed of water to the air
scavenging valves with a view to effecting cooling of the
engine, but abandoned it owing to lack of results. Very
soon I discovered that for every gallon of petrol the engine
consumed I could let it take nearly half a gallon of water
into the induction pipe. The engine ran much quieter
and very smoothly, and for a time I thought I had succeeded,
although the water gave me trouble in restarting if I happened
to stop the engine while it was in use. It meant
that the water had to be shut off some minutes before the
engine was going to be stopped. The day after I thought
I had effected a cure for the pre-ignition <i>intermittent knocking</i>
began, and there was also general knocking <i>always</i> for
a second or two when <i>accelerating quickly under load</i>. After
much loss of time and the expenditure of a large sum of
money on experiments, I persuaded the Syndicate to let
me take some diagrams from the engine with an optical
indicator, and eventually after nine months they consented,
but they would not agree to my taking the engine out
of the chassis and putting it on the bench for a proper
<i>power test</i>. Therefore my diagrams were taken while
the engine was in the garage in its chassis, and the load
was applied by the propellor shaft brake, the shaft itself
being withdrawn. Anyone who has attempted even in
a well-equipped laboratory and with the aid of a proper
brake to take diagrams from a petrol engine when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
indicator is driven by a <i>flexible shaft</i>, will understand and
appreciate my work in securing thirty photographic records
under as many conditions of load and speed. After carefully
analyzing my diagrams, I came to the conclusion that
the intermittent knocking was undoubtedly <i>flashing back</i>
from the exhaust, and the acceleration knocking was due
to a <i>cushion of hot gas</i> which accumulated in the head end
of the cylinder at times when the engine speed was low
and the load on the engine was heavy.</p>

<p>Having explained these things to the Syndicate and
pointed out the need for still larger valves, they set about
attempting to raise fresh capital for the final attempt at
success. They were not successful, and up to the present
nothing more has been done. The Syndicate was wound
up, the members drifted apart, and the patents were
allowed to lapse.</p>

<p>The engine and chassis were eventually sold, and are still
doing good service somewhere in the North of England.
Meantime the writer has not rested, but has steadily formulated
his ideas for the improvement of the engine, which
have resulted in the securing of a fresh patent early this
year. In the new engine the charge enters at the head end
of the cylinder, there is a special transverse combustion
chamber, and many improvements are introduced in the
scavenging and flow of gases; also there is no deflector at
all on the piston head. Funds have not yet been secured
to enable an experimental engine to be constructed, but
it is to be hoped they will be forthcoming, for the benefit of
the motor-car industry generally, as the future undoubtedly
lies with the two-stroke.</p>

<p>During the whole of this time the writer was engaged
as Chief Assistant in the Engineering Department of Leeds
University, being in charge of the experimental work of
the students in the laboratories there. Many of the
drawings were made by students in their vacation, and
the writer is greatly indebted to his friend, Professor John<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
Goodman, for so kindly allowing him the necessary freedom
during vacation times when there is often much miscellaneous
work that requires attention.</p>

<p>Before closing this chapter one may add a few words
on carburation and ignition for two-stroke engines. A
four-cylinder two-stroke engine should have cranks at
right angles to secure the maximum torque on the shaft.
Looked at in end view the cranks form the four arms of a
cross and thus four impulses are given every revolution,
but as the ordinary magneto only gives two sparks in every
revolution it must be driven at <i>twice</i> the crankshaft speed.
This puts a great strain on the machine at top speed, and
also on the insulation of the windings and the plugs, so
that the plugs require constant attention. Magneto troubles
were found to be eliminated by the use of the special <i>racing</i>
pattern magneto supplied by some manufacturers and
the choice of high grade sparking plugs.</p>

<p>Carburation troubles were not so easily dealt with. A
multi-cylinder two-stroke engine should undoubtedly have
a multiple jet carburettor and some form of hand-controlled
<i>extra-air</i> inlet valve on the induction pipe; also
the mixing chamber of the carburettor should be water-jacketed
by <i>hot</i> water. It was also found necessary to
fit a hot water-jacket round a portion of the induction
pipe, as the demand for petrol vapour was so great and the
rate of evaporation so high that frost readily formed on
the induction pipe unless the weather was very warm.
The two-stroke engine requires its petrol much faster than
the four-stroke, so that the float of the carburettor should
be delicately balanced and the height of the petrol in the
jet should be quite level with the top of the orifice, although
this often leads to flooding.</p>

<p>Reviewing the description of what we have designated
the Kean two-stroke engine, we may sum up the results
of these experiments by saying that the engine <i>could</i>
have developed considerably more power than it did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
had diagrams been taken from it in the first instance
and the severe throttling in the carburettor and automatic
inlet valves been discovered; moreover, the flashing
back from the exhaust would have been located
much sooner and probably cured by a re-arrangement of
the exhaust manifold. If the exhaust manifold had been
arranged so that there was a separate branch for at least
each pair of cylinders, it would very likely have been stopped,
or at any rate greatly reduced. But what could not have
been altered was the <i>acceleration knocking</i>. It must not be
imagined because I have been very frank in the criticism
of my own work that the engine was a failure; it was a
great <i>success</i>, but not sufficiently successful to represent
an improvement on the best four-stroke practice. The
car ran well, was very reliable and efficient in petrol consumption;
the engine was quiet and extremely flexible;
but it had one very objectionable feature in that every
time you pressed the accelerator pedal down sharply, either
to put on a spurt for the purpose of passing slower traffic
or in <i>rushing</i> a short gradient, a peculiar knocking or hammering
arose from the engine cylinders—this is what I
describe as acceleration knocking and must not be confused
with the knocking or hammering of a four-stroke
engine when labouring on a gradient. My engine would
be <i>full of life</i> all the time it was knocking like this, and
gradually as the speed increased the noise would ease-off,
even though no change of gear had been made.</p>

<p>The diagrams proved to me that this knocking was due
to <i>pre-ignition</i> caused by a cushion of hot gases remaining
in the top of the working cylinder, and in my opinion no
alteration of the ports or cylinder head would have influenced
this defect to any marked extent; therefore I should
never attempt again to feed the new charge in at the <i>bottom</i>
end of the cylinder of a two-stroke engine if I wished to
obtain the maximum amount of power from it. It seems
to me that other people must also have been impressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
with similar misgivings, for in one or two types of engine
using crankchamber compression we see a special attempt
made to overcome it, although the method adopted leads
to a rather undesirable arrangement of the engine mechanism.
In the type of engine I refer to the charge may be
drawn into the crankchamber in the usual manner, if desired,
but the working cylinder is a casting with two bores
having two separate pistons and a common combustion
chamber. The charge enters above one piston while the
crank is on its bottom dead-centre and is exhausted from
the space above the other piston simultaneously, and the
path of the gases is from the inlet port up to the top of No. (1)
bore, then down to No. (2) bore, and out of the exhaust.
This ensures that there shall be no cushion of hot exhaust
gases left in the combustion chamber (or top end of the
cylinder).</p>

<p>These engines have given quite good results, and would
be much more extensively used but for the fact that there
is double compression to overcome in starting, and their
running torque, due to the number of impulses given to
the crankshaft, is no better than a four-stroke engine. Fig.
66 shows the arrangement of the cylinders and the path
of the gases. A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> are the twin pistons working in
the water-jacketed cylinder casting B, and having the common
combustion chamber C. The connecting rods may
drive separate cranks in opposite directions or both be
coupled together and work a single crank. It will be seen
that in this type of engine the piston does not require
any deflector.</p>

<p>The simple two-stroke engine described at the beginning
of this chapter is often constructed in such a form that no
automatic inlet valve is required on the crankchamber.</p>

<p>In this case the induction pipe is connected to a third
set of ports just below and a little to one side of the inlet
ports to the working cylinder, and these are uncovered by
the piston towards the completion of its upstroke, thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
allowing the carburetted air to enter the crankchamber.
Such an arrangement constitutes a <i>three-port</i> two-stroke
engine, which is of course <i>less efficient</i> than a two-port
engine with automatic valve, but has the great merit that
it is entirely <i>valveless</i>, and therefore extremely simple and
cheap to manufacture. It is much used for motor boat
work, both in this country and in America, on account
of its relatively low speed of rotation.</p>

HORSE POWER AND THE INDICATOR DIAGRAM</h2>


<p>A book on “The Petrol Engine” would hardly be complete
without some reference to horse-power and the indicator
diagram. The following definitions must be carefully
studied.</p>

<p><b>Work.</b>—A force is said to do mechanical work when it
overcomes a resistance in its own <i>line of action</i>. The line
of action of a force is a line indicating the direction in which
the force acts. Engineers <i>measure</i> work in foot-pound
units. The product obtained when we multiply the magnitude
of the force or resistance (in pounds) by the distance
through which it has acted or been overcome (expressed
in feet) gives the quantity of work done in foot-pounds.</p>

<p><i>Example</i>:—A force of 50 lbs. is exerted in overcoming
a resistance through a distance of 12 feet. Find the work
done.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="pform">
Work done = Force (in lbs.) × Distance (in ft.)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">= 50 × 12 = <b>600 ft. lbs.</b></span><br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Power.</b>—The <i>rate</i> at which work is done is a measure
of the power exerted. One horse-power is exerted when
33,000 foot-pounds of work are done in one minute. The
work done per minute (in ft. lbs.) divided by 33,000 gives
the horse-power expended.</p>

<p><i>Example</i>:—To propel a motor-car along a level road
at a speed of 30 miles an hour requires a tractive effort
or pull of 70 lbs. if the vehicle weighs one ton. Find the
horse-power required, at the road surface.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="pform">

Horse-power = Work done per minute in ft. lbs./33,000
<br />
 = Force (in lbs.) × Distance through which it acts per minute (in ft)./33,000

 = (70 × 30 × 5280/60)/33,000 = (7 × 264)/330 = <b>5·6</b>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><i>Example</i>:—If the car in the preceding example had to
climb a gradient which rose one foot for every four feet
traversed by the car, find the additional horse-power needed
to keep up a speed of 30 miles an hour while climbing the
gradient.</p>

<p>Here we have to raise a weight of 1 ton vertically upwards
through a height equal to one-fourth of the road surface
covered, every minute.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="pform">Additional Horse-power required</p>

<p class="pform">
 = (2240 (lbs.) × (30 × 5280/60) × ¼ ft. per min.)/33,000<br />

 = (2240 × 660)/33,000 = <b>44·8</b>
</p>

<p>Total Horse-power to climb the gradient of 1 in 4
at 30 miles an hour = 5·6 + 44·8 = <b>50·4</b></p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Brake Horse-Power.</b>—The length of the circumference
or boundary line of a circle is 6·28 times the length
of the radius of the circle or 3·14 times the length of its
diameter. Hence, if an engine exerts a pull of P lbs. at
the end of a brake arm of length R feet when it is maintaining
a speed of N revolutions per minute (we may imagine
the brake to be fitted round the rim of the flywheel),
we can calculate the <b>brake horse-power</b> thus:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="pform">
Brake Horse-Power or B.H.P. <br />
 = (Work done on the brake per minute in ft. lbs.)/33,000</p>

<p class="pform">
hence B.H.P = (Pull at the end of the brake arm (in lbs.)) × (6·28 times the radius
of the arm (in feet)) × (the number of revolutions made by the engine (in one minute))/33,000<br />
= (P × 6·28 × R × N)/33,000</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="figcenter">
<a id="fig_67"></a>
<img src="images/i_100.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="pcap">Fig. 67.—Petrol Engine Brake.</p></div>
</div>

<p><i>Example</i>:—An engine being tested by a brake applied
to the flywheel as shown in the sketch (Fig. <a href="#fig_67">67</a>) exerts a
pull of 50 lbs. at a speed of 2,000 revolutions per minute.
If the length of brake arm is 30 inches, calculate the brake
horse-power developed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="pform">Work done per minute = 50 × 6·28 × 30/12 × 2000 ft. lbs.</p>

<p class="pform">
B.H.P. = (50 × 6·28 × 30/12 × 2000)/33,000 = 47·5
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Rated Horse-Power.</b>—For taxation purposes the
Treasury makes use of a formula for the rating of petrol
engines according to their probable horse-power. This
formula is based on a certain speed of the piston which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
was regarded as a limiting value some years ago (when
the formula was first proposed) and on the attainment
of a certain effective pressure in the cylinder.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="pform">
Horse-power from the Treasury formula = 0·4 d<sup>2</sup>n.</p>
<p class="pform">
Where d = diameter of cylinder in inches,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">n = number of cylinders.</span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With modern engines much greater horse-power is obtained,
and a near approximation to the true output is
obtained by using what is now known as the Joint Committee’s
formula.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="pform">
Brake Horse-Power = 0·46 n (d + s) (d - 1·18)</p>
<p class="pform">
Where d = diameter of cylinder in inches.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">s = length of piston’s stroke in inches.</span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This formula is only to be used in an attempt to predict
the <i>probable</i> maximum horse-power which any engine will
give. It must not be confused with the ordinary brake
horse-power formula.</p>

<p><i>Example</i>:—Find the probable maximum horse-power
of an engine having four cylinders each 3 in. bore and a
piston stroke of 4 in. What would be its horse-power for
taxation purposes?</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="pform">
<i>By Joint Committee’s formula</i>—</p>
<p class="pform">
B.H.P. = 0·46 × 4 (3 + 4)(3 - 1·18) = 1·84 × 7 × 1·82<br />
 = <b>23·35</b></p>
<p class="pform">
<i>By Treasury formula</i>—</p>
<p class="pform">
B.H.P = 0·4 × 3<sup>2</sup> × 4 = 0·4 × 9 × 4 = <b>14·4</b>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Indicated Horse-Power.</b>—The horse-power which an
indicator would show as being developed inside the cylinder
of a petrol engine, above the piston, would be called
the <i>indicated</i> horse-power, and should always work out a
greater number than the brake horse-power or power available
at the engine flywheel, because some of the power
liberated from the combustion of the petrol within the
cylinder is lost in friction of the piston and bearings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="pform">
The Indicated Horse-Power or I.H.P. = (P<sub>e</sub> × A × L x N<sub>e</sub>)/33,000.</p>
<p class="pform">
Where P<sub>e</sub> = mean effective pressure from the diagram, in lbs. per sq. inch.<br />

A = area of piston in square inches = 0·7854(diameter of cylinder)<sup>2</sup><br />

L = length of stroke of piston, in feet.<br />

N<sub>e</sub> = number of power impulses per minute
delivered to the crankshaft.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since a four-stroke engine gives one power impulse to
the crankshaft in every two revolutions, it follows that N<sub>e</sub>
is equal to <i>half</i> the number of revolutions per minute for
a single-cylinder engine of that type, and <i>twice</i> the number
of revolutions for a four-cylinder engine. A four-cylinder
two-stroke engine might be arranged to give either <i>two or
four</i> impulses per revolution of the crankshaft—depending
upon the arrangement of the cranks.</p>

<p><i>Example</i>:—A four-cylinder four-stroke engine runs at
a speed of 2,000 revolutions per minute and the mean-effective
pressure in the cylinders is 75 lbs. per square inch.
Calculate the indicated horse-power if the cylinders are
4 in. × 4 in.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="pform">
<b>I.H.P</b> = (P<sub>e</sub> × A × L × N<sub>e</sub>)/33,000<br />
 = (75 × 0·7854 × 4<sup>2</sup> × 4/12 × 4000}/33,000<br />
 = {75 × 12·56 × 4000}/99,000 = <b>38</b>
</p></blockquote>

<p><b>The Indicator Diagram.</b>—At the commencement of
this chapter we explained that the work done by a force
was measured by multiplying the number representing the
magnitude of the force (in pounds) by the distance through
which it had acted (measured in feet). This product gave
us the quantity of work done in foot-pound units. Thus
“<i>quantity of work done</i>” is really the product of two numbers,
just as the area of a rectangular floor space is meas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>ured
by length times breadth. In symbols we write W =
F × S where F is the magnitude of the force or resistance in
pounds and S the distance through which it has acted, in
feet. It is interesting to contemplate this symbolical
expression W = F × S together with the expression
Area = Length × Breadth, because it gives us a new idea
for measuring work. Imagine a diagram of the kind shown
in Fig. <a href="#fig_68">68</a>, in which the curved line AB has been obtained
by <i>plotting</i> values of F and S for any imaginary case. The
diagram is supposed to represent pictorially how the particular
force under consideration has varied in magnitude
as it has traversed a space represented, to some scale, by
the length DC. It is clearly seen that the force has been
<i>decreasing</i> in an <i>irregular</i> manner from some large value
represented by the height DA to a small value represented
by the height CB. We now proceed to show that the
shaded area ABCD measures the total amount of work
done by this force.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<img src="images/i_103.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="pcap">Fig. 68.—Force-space or <i>Work</i> Diagram.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Considering for a moment just the small strip <i>efdc</i> of
the diagram we see that it is easy to find a rectangle <i>abcd</i>
equal in area to it. Now the <i>height</i> of this rectangle will
be the <i>average value</i> of the force while it traversed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
space <i>cd</i>, and hence the area of the rectangle <i>abcd</i> gives the
<b>work done</b> by the force in passing from <i>c</i> to <i>d</i>. Similarly
by dividing up the whole diagram we would obtain a number
of little rectangles each equal in area to the magnitude
of the work done from point to point. Thus the whole
area ABCD gives the whole work done. To measure the
work done in an engine cylinder we must use some form
of <i>indicator</i>. An indicator is an instrument which traces
out a diagram on which <i>abscissæ</i> (or horizontal distances)
represent displacements of the piston and <i>ordinates</i> (or
vertical distances) represent the pressures acting on the
piston.</p>

</div>

<p>Ordinary steam engine indicators with pencil motion and
paper drum are not suitable for use with fast running petrol
engines. The moving parts of these indicators are too
heavy and their springs too sluggish in action to keep correct
time with these high speed engines. Again, there
is too much friction between the pencil and the paper drum,
as well as in the lever joints. Therefore special indicators
have to be used, in which the diagram is traced out by a
beam of light reflected from a mirror on to a ground glass
screen or photographic plate. One corner of the mirror
is tilted in time with the movement of the engine piston
by means of a special reducing mechanism, and another
corner of the mirror is tilted in a direction at right angles
to the first by means of a very short thin rod kept in contact
with a metal diaphragm subjected to the pressure of
the gases in the engine cylinder. A beam of light is thrown
on to the mirror from a lamp, and after reflection traces
out the diagram on the screen or plate. Such an instrument
would generally be described as a <i>manograph</i>. An
indicator diagram from a four-stroke engine is shown in
Fig. <a href="#fig_69">69</a>. The line ABC represents the suction stroke of
the piston during which the pressure of the gases in the
cylinder falls a little below that of the atmosphere. Atmospheric
pressure is shown by the height of the line LL<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
above the base, or line of zero pressure (perfect vacuum).
The inlet valve can be opened at B and closed at D after
the crank has turned the bottom dead-centre and begun
the compression stroke. The line CDE represents the
compression stroke of the engine, during which the gases
are compressed and their pressure rises. The height of
the point E above the line LL gives the <i>compression pressure</i>
to the scale of the diagram. Ignition occurs at E,
and results in an instantaneous rise of pressure to F due
to the explosion, which is, however, quickly followed by
expansion to G. The exhaust valve opens at G, the gases
are <i>released</i>, and the pressure falls still further to point H.
The line HA represents the exhaust stroke of the piston,
and the exhaust valve would be closed after the crank
had passed its upper dead-centre and commenced the
suction stroke. The distance marked (x) on the diagram
measures the <i>clearance</i> volume (or volume of the space
above the piston containing the valves and referred to as
the combustion chamber) to the same scale that the length<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
of the diagram measures the volumetric displacement of
the piston. The volume traced out by the piston during
any working stroke is measured by multiplying the area
of the piston in square (centimetres/inches) by the length
of the stroke in (centimetres/inches) the product giving us
the capacity of the cylinder in cubic (centimetres/inches). The
area of the diagram HEFG gives the work done during
one cycle of operations, and the area of the small diagram
ABCD gives the work lost in taking in and expelling the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
charge. The small area should be subtracted from the
large one to get the useful work done per cycle of operations.
The area of the diagram HEFG may readily be
obtained by finding its vertical height at a number of equidistant
points, and from these measurements ascertaining
the average or <i>mean</i> height of the diagram. The average
height of the diagram (in inches) multiplied by its length
(also in inches) gives the area in square inches.</p>

<img src="images/i_106.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="pcap">Fig. 70.—Indicator Diagram from a Two-stroke Engine.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The average or mean height of the diagram also gives
what we term the <i>mean effective pressure</i> acting on the
piston, and constitutes the P<sub>e</sub> of the indicated horse-power
formula above. The area ABCD is always small and
generally neglected with four-stroke engines. There are
<i>two separate diagrams</i> for a two-stroke engine. The diagram
for the working cylinder is A<sub>1</sub>B<sub>1</sub>C<sub>1</sub>D<sub>1</sub> in Fig. <a href="#fig_70">70</a>,
and that for the crankchamber is E<sub>1</sub>F<sub>1</sub>G<sub>1</sub>H<sub>1</sub>. The effective
work done per cycle is measured by the difference in
the area of these two diagrams. The piston uncovers
the exhaust port at B<sub>1</sub> and closes it again at C<sub>1</sub>; it uncovers
the inlet port at F<sub>1</sub> and covers it again at G<sub>1</sub>. From
F<sub>1</sub> to G<sub>1</sub> the charge is being delivered from the crankchamber
to the working cylinder. The area of the loop
E<sub>1</sub>F<sub>1</sub>G<sub>1</sub>H<sub>1</sub> is larger than the corresponding portion of the
four-stroke diagram and should not be neglected.</p>

LIQUID FUELS</h2>


<p>Important factors in the choice of a liquid fuel for use
in portable internal combustion engines are: (1) low cost;
(2) ease and safety of transportation or storage; (3) high
volatility, i.e., readily convertible into vapour; (4) non-corrosive
action on metals; (5) high heat efficiency; (6) ability
to give satisfactory results in existing types of internal
combustion engine.</p>

<p><b>Petrol</b> is a liquid fuel composed of carbon (C) and hydrogen
(H) in chemical combination. The principal method
of producing petrol is by distillation of crude petroleum.
The best mixture to use in a petrol engine is one composed
of 2 cubic feet of petrol vapour to every 98 cubic feet of
air. Petrol does not require any heat to vaporize it
under ordinary atmospheric conditions. <i>Pre-ignition</i> of
the charge is liable to occur if the compression pressure
exceeds 100 lbs. per square inch. It does not corrode or
deteriorate metal parts, but leaves a black carbon deposit
if not properly burned. Its volatility is high and its
specific gravity is low, being about 0·71. An average figure
for the calorific value of petrol would be 20,000 B. Th. U.
per lb. Petrol is very expensive and also needs care in
handling. Private motorists are not allowed to <i>store</i> petrol
or benzol.</p>

<p><b>Benzol</b> is a liquid fuel containing more carbon (C) and
less hydrogen (H) than petrol. The principal method of
obtaining benzol is by distillation of coal tar. The strength
of the mixture should be such that a little more air is supplied
in proportion to the quantity of fuel used than is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
required for petrol. Generally, it may be said that when
an engine has been running on petrol and is changed over
to benzol the size of the carburettor jet orifice should be
slightly reduced and the weight of the float increased—no
other changes need be made anywhere. Benzol is
very volatile and also highly dangerous to handle, on account
of its low flash-point. It often contains impurities
which attack the metal parts of the engine and gum up
the valves. It is more liable to deposit carbon than petrol.
Benzol attacks rubber, and paint on coachwork. It is
as expensive as petrol at the present time. The specific
gravity of benzol may be taken as 0·88 and its calorific
value as 19,000 B. Th. U. per lb. It may be compressed
above 100 lbs. per square inch without pre-igniting.</p>

<p><b>Alcohol</b> is a liquid fuel composed of carbon (C), hydrogen
(H), and oxygen (O). The principal method of obtaining
alcohol is from the fermentation of vegetable matter,
such as potatoes, beetroot, etc. About 6 cubic feet of
vaporized alcohol to every 94 cubic feet of air should be
used. The volatility of alcohol is very poor compared
with petrol or benzol, and it generally contains some water
in suspension. It will stand double the compression pressure
of petrol without pre-igniting. Alcohol is not so
liable to deposit carbon as petrol or benzol, but is very
liable to cause rust. It is not obtainable as a fuel in Great
Britain at present, owing to the high duty on it. Engines
for use with alcohol ought really to be specially constructed
for the purpose. Its calorific value is only 12,000 B. Th. U.
per lb., and its specific gravity is 0·82. Alcohol requires
to be heated before it will vaporize, this heat generally
being obtained from the exhaust gases after the engine has
been first started up. Alcohol is fairly safe to handle or
store.</p>

<p><b>Paraffin</b> is obtained during the distillation of petrol
from crude petroleum, and consists of carbon (C) and hydrogen
(H) in <i>almost</i> the same proportions as petrol. Its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
volatility is low, and it requires heat to vaporize it. The
heat required for vaporization is usually obtained from the
exhaust gases after the engine has been got running. In
starting up a lamp must be used for heating the vaporizer
of the carburettor. Paraffin will stand a little higher
compression than petrol before pre-igniting. The specific
gravity of paraffin may be taken as 0·80 and its calorific
value as 18,000 B. Th. U. per lb. It is much cheaper than
either petrol or benzol, being only about one-third of the
cost. The chief objections to its use are its smell and
the greasy character of the stain left by it on coachwork
or clothes; also the difficulty of having to heat the
vaporizing chamber of the carburettor. It is much
safer to handle and store than either petrol or benzol, and
requires about the same proportion of air to form an
explosive mixture as that given for petrol. The range
of variation of strength in the mixture which is permissible
with paraffin is much less than with either petrol, benzol,
or alcohol. Alcohol has the greatest range of variation
in mixture strength. Paraffin is also very liable to deposit
carbon, owing to the small range of variation permissible
in the strength of the mixture.</p>

<p><b>Thermal Efficiency.</b>—In the foregoing notes we have
used certain terms which have not previously been explained,
and therefore it is necessary to give one or two

<p>The <i>Specific Gravity</i> of a fuel is the ratio of the weight
of one gallon of the fuel to the weight of one gallon of water.
As a gallon of water weighs 10 lbs., it will be evident from
the above notes that a gallon of petrol only weighs 7·1 lbs.,
whereas a gallon of benzol will weigh 8·8 lbs. (approx.),
hence it is not surprising to learn that more <i>mileage per
gallon</i> is obtained with benzol than with petrol, even though
the calorific value of benzol, per lb., is less than that of
petrol. Sometimes the specific gravity is referred to as
the <i>density</i> of the fuel, but this is only correct when grammes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
and centimetres are being used. The density of any fuel
is the weight of 1 cubic foot expressed in pounds or, in
general terms, the mass of unit volume of the fuel. The
<i>density</i> of petrol in English units would be about 44 lbs.
per cubic foot.</p>

<p>One <i>British Thermal Unit</i> is the quantity of heat required
to raise the temperature of 1 lb. of water by 1 degree
(Fahrenheit scale) when the temperature of the water is
about 60°F.</p>

<p>The <i>Calorific Value</i> of any fuel (reckoned on the British
system of units) is the amount of heat (expressed in British
Thermal Units) which will be given out by 1 lb. of the fuel
when it is completely burned. The liquid fuels we have
to deal with are hydrocarbon compounds, and when completely
burned the whole of the carbon is burned to
carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and the hydrogen to steam (H<sub>2</sub>O),
leaving no residue. By means of a <i>calorimeter</i> we can
experimentally determine the calorific value of any
fuel.</p>

<p>It has long been known that work can be turned into
heat, and the petrol engine is a good example of the reverse
process which consists in turning heat into work. In a
steam engine and boiler plant the heat of the fuel is liberated
under the boiler, and then a portion of it gets transferred
to the water in the boiler and forms steam, which is
then taken to the engine and does work in the cylinder,
the whole being a wasteful process. The petrol engine is an
<i>internal combustion</i> engine, or one in which the fuel is burnt
inside the engine cylinder itself and converted directly
into work. From every British Thermal Unit of heat
liberated by the combustion of the fuel in the cylinder
we should be able to get 778 foot-pounds of work if the
<i>thermal</i> (or heat) <i>efficiency</i> of the engine was 100 per cent.
The thermal efficiency (η) of any engine may be defined
as the ratio which the heat equivalent of the work done
per minute by the engine bears to the heat which would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
be liberated by the complete combustion of the quantity
of fuel admitted to the cylinder per minute. Thus—</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="pform">
η = ((Horse-power of the Engine × 33,000)/778)/((Number of pounds of fuel consumed per minute)
× (Calorific Value of the fuel))
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Example</i>:—An engine developing 30 horse-power uses
0·50 lb. of benzol per minute. What is its thermal efficiency?
The calorific value of benzol may be taken as 19,000
B. Th. U. per lb.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="pform">
η = (30 × 33,000/778)/(0·50 × 19,000) = 0·134, or 13·4 per cent.

ENGINE TROUBLES</h2>


<p>Many of the troubles that are likely to arise have already been
referred to in previous chapters, but the following additional
notes may be found useful.</p>

<p><b>1. Engine refuses to start.</b></p>

<p>Care must be taken to observe exactly what happens, and one
cannot do better than ask oneself mentally some of the following
questions.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Is the ignition “on”?</i></p>

<p>If a magneto is fitted the earth connexion should be open,
but if a coil and accumulator are fitted the earth connexion
should be closed.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Is the petrol reaching the carburettor jet?</i></p>

<p>Before removing the jet for the purpose of examining and
cleaning it, it would be advisable to ascertain whether the petrol
was reaching the float chamber. Provided there is a reasonable
amount of petrol in the tank and the tap is turned on, there
must be a stoppage either in the petrol filter, the petrol pipe,
or the bottom portion of the float chamber. Examine the filter
and float chamber before disconnecting any pipes.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Is there a good compression in all the cylinders?</i></p>

<p>If there does not appear to be any compression in any of the
cylinders, it is probable that the carburettor throttle is closed
and no air or gas can enter the cylinders. If there is a good
compression in some cylinders and a poor one or none at all in
others then—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1) One or more of the valves may be held off its seat by dirt,
by distortion, or by some derangement of the valve gear.
Examine the valve gear externally, turning the engine
slowly to watch its action. Afterwards remove valve
caps and inspect valves if necessary.</p>

<p>(2) One or more of the sparking plugs or valve caps may be
short of its washer. In this case the blow will be heard
as the engine is turned round by hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span></p>

<p>(3) A piston may be cracked or broken or a cylinder cracked.</p>

<p>(4) A cylinder may have got badly worn and the rings on the
piston jammed so that they no longer keep it gas-tight.</p></blockquote>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>Is the engine very stiff to turn over?</i></p>

<p>Stiffness is due as a rule to lack of oil on the cylinder walls,
caused by absence of oil in crankchamber or the film of oil on
the cylinder walls having been washed off when <i>priming</i> the
engine with petrol in attempting to start it. If a connecting rod
is bent, or the crankshaft distorted or a piston ring broken, stiffness
will also be noted. Very often by removing the valve caps and
pouring a teaspoonful of oil or paraffin into each cylinder the
engine may be freed by vigorously turning the starting handle
by hand until the cylinders and pistons are well lubricated.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) <i>Is there any sign of an attempt to fire the charge</i> such as an
occasional puff of smoke from the exhaust or inlet, or an occasional
jerk round of the engine as you turn the starting handle, or an
occasional “bang” in the exhaust box?</p>

<p>If the ignition is “<i>on</i>” and the carburettor jet clear, the
compression good and the engine quite free, yet there is no sign
of a “fire” from any of the cylinders, it is possible that air is
leaking into the induction pipe through a faulty joint or any one
of the following ignition troubles may have occurred:—</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) <i>Defective sparking plug or plugs.</i> This may arise from
water or oil or dirt between the plug points; or from faulty
insulation in the body of the plug. To test whether the plugs
are at fault an easy method is to take a screwdriver with a wooden
handle and place the metal blade on the terminal of the plug,
letting the point come about one thirty-second of an inch from
the metal of the cylinder or any of the pipes; when the engine
is turned by hand the spark will be seen to pass across this improvised
gap if the magneto and leads are in order.</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) <i>Defective electrical connexions.</i></p>

<p>The high tension cables may be broken, or disconnected, or
short-circuited. The <i>earth</i> wire may be short-circuited (i.e.,
in electrical contact with some other wire or metal fitting). There
may be a short-circuit in the ignition switch.</p>

<p>(<i>h</i>) <i>Defective magneto or coil.</i></p>

<p>The low tension contact breaker lever may be jammed so that
the make and break is inoperative, or one of the carbon brushes
may have got broken. Occasionally one finds the magnets of
the machine have lost their power; or there is some electrical
defect in the armature or condenser. The battery may have
become exhausted. The trembler blade may be stuck up.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
Water may have found its way on to the high tension electrode
or into the safety spark gap.</p>

<p><b>2. Engine starts up fairly well, runs a little, and then
stops.</b></p>

<p>Take care to notice the manner in which the engine runs and
stops. Note whether it runs regularly or irregularly and for
how long a time.</p>

<p>If the engine runs <i>regularly</i> with all cylinders firing, then
probably the exhaust is choked or the petrol supply fails. Failure
of the petrol supply may be due to the use of too small a jet
in the carburettor, too low a level in the float chamber, or to
partial stoppage in the pipe line. Another cause of this trouble
of intermittent running would sometimes be loss of battery power
when using coil ignition, i.e., batteries want recharging.</p>

<p>If the engine runs <i>irregularly</i> the trouble is probably due to too
much oil in the cylinders causing the plugs to <i>misfire</i>, the presence
of water or dirt in the petrol, a defective valve, a broken carbon
brush, or poor electrical contact somewhere in the magneto, the
low tension contact breaker (coil), or high tension distributor
(coil).</p>

<p>To ascertain whether the engine is firing regularly on all cylinders,
or to detect which cylinder is <i>misfiring</i>, the best procedure
is to open the compression taps in turn while the engine is running
and in each case speed up the engine while you have the tap
open. Cylinders which are firing <i>well</i> give a sharp <i>cracking</i>
noise, those which are not firing merely give a <i>hissing</i> noise. If
no compression taps are provided, each plug must be short-circuited
to the frame in turn by the screwdriver method given
above. The short-circuiting process causes a reduction in engine
speed except on that plug which is already not firing. The
method is not so good as the compression tap process, because
the plugs often get oiled up during the short-circuiting process
and the difficulty is accentuated.</p>

<p><b>3. Timing the Ignition.</b></p>

<p>My colleague, Mr. Oliver Mitchell, has pointed out to me that
it is often impossible to tell directly when the piston is exactly
at the top of its stroke, and he recommends a study of the accompanying
Valve Setting Diagram (Figure 71). From this it will
be seen that it is sufficiently near to bring the engine first of all
to such a position that the exhaust valve has <i>just closed</i>; then
make a chalk mark on the flywheel and give the engine one
complete turn round; the piston will then be in the firing position
if the flywheel is turned a shade backwards. Another method
would be to <i>retard</i> the ignition fully and time it so that the spark<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
occurred one complete revolution after the <i>inlet</i> valve had <i>just
commenced to open</i>. When either valve is closed its tappet can
be felt to be <i>free</i>, the amount of freedom depending upon the
clearance between the tappet head and valve stem.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
